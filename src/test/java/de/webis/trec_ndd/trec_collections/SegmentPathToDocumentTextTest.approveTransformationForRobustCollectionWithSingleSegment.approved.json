    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition NEW FALLOUT FROM CHERNOBYL; THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER BY DAVID R. MARPLES (ST. MARTIN\u0027S PRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0) The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples\u0027 new book, his second on the Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in Moscow official circles. The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the event and its continuing aftermath. The effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels are generally appropriate. The book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader\u0027s inspection. The modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough index. First in the world\u0027s attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties. Widespread \"radiophobia\" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program. But the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is well when it isn\u0027t. And thus is born what he properly labels the \"myth of Chernobyl,\" the official line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor. \"In the Soviet view,\" he writes, \"it was first and foremost a victory, a story with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant.\" Thus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future \"excess cancer deaths\" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets reacted furiously. The estimates are branded \"nonsense\" and the estimators are dismissed as \"panic mongers\" promulgating \"anti-Soviet venom.\" Subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on operator training levels. A severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be the primary culprit. Ultimately, observes the author, \"It is ironic that in an era of openness, Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then subsequently its first casualty.\" He ultimately concludes, \"Aspects of the disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by Soviet sources.\" Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties. The July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure. Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their substance has ever been released. The propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he maintains, had one goal: \"To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in Kiev and especially in Moscow.\" This is precisely the theme I have also encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains absolutely off limits to glasnost. The closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition. Viktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country\u0027s two leading pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor implementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and most eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident, by committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the circumstances of his \"tragic death,\" even issuing official non-explanations which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation. Finally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov\u0027s notebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to know these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the \"big picture\" of the catastrophe\u0027s social impacts. For an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest quality of scholarship. Readers of Marples\u0027 book will rarely be surprised as the Chernobyl catastrophe\u0027s consequences continue to unfold in the future.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition THE ARISTOCRAT AS INDEPENDENT VOTER; TOCQUEVILLE A BIOGRAPHY BY ANDRE JARDIN; TRANSLATED BY LYDIA DAVIS WITH ROBERT HEMENWAY(FARRAR, STRAUS \u0026 GIROUX: $30; 548 PP.) Andre Jardin\u0027s \"Tocqueville,\" surprisingly the first full-scale biography of this major 19th-Century figure, is a fine, old-fashioned piece of work, some of it original, much of it taken from the ample precedent scholarship. It provides an abundant store of information and an occasional surprise -- a dozen years after its publication, we find the author of \"Democracy in America,\" now minister of foreign affairs, exclaiming: \"But what animals these Americans are!\" It is as the author of \"Democracy in America\" that Tocqueville is known in this country; but what this biography reveals is not so much an admirer of America as a Frenchman of his time, circumstance and needs, even when he is in America. He came here with his friend Beaumont ostensibly as a student of penitentiary reform, but Tocqueville really wanted to take a larger look at this new republic, since it was clear to him that the European drift was in that direction, and what intrigued him was its democratic base, since he had been brought up to believe that a republic could function only when run by a virtuous elite. We know what he found and how he responded, but the biography also reveals, almost inadvertently, why he was such an accurate and comparatively unbiased observer. For one thing, he had not biased himself by reading contemporary travel literature, much of it written by snide Tories pretending to take an unprejudiced look at the American experiment. Capt. Basil Hall\u0027s infamous \"Travels\" had been only partially translated (the chapter on prison reform) into French, and, in any event, it was his companion Beaumont who read it. The result was that Tocqueville\u0027s vision had not been prejudiced (other than by his relative Chateaubriand\u0027s romance with New World nature). For another, Tocqueville and Beaumont readied themselves each day by preparing questions for the people they would meet, questions based upon their own observations sur place and designed to elicit responses useful to them as Frenchmen trying to prepare themselves for a possible future. They were not, as were the Tories, justifying a past. Tocqueville\u0027s Cartesian clarity, his relative lack of bias, meant that he used the answers to his questions to form a useful statement about America, but the questions themselves and their reasons reveal perhaps even more about France. By looking at this intelligent, open-minded, and inquiring young civil servant and nobleman of impeccable political parentage (great grandson of Malesherbes), Jardin\u0027s book provides the American reader a marvelous introduction to the political shiftings, the gradual yet sometimes violent post-revolutionary cracking of the political structure in France as it grappled simultaneously with the shattered legitimacy of the past, a slippery present and an ill-defined future. After the immediate success of \"Democracy in America\" (1835), Tocqueville entered the political arena and was elected deputy for the arrondissement of Valognes, the region of his family castle in Normandy. He sat left of center in the Chamber. Although many at the time thought of him as an Carlist aristocrat and some in this country think of him as an American-style conservative, Tocqueville considered the old aristocracy \"dead for ever.\" Over the years, he demonstrated his liberalism by fighting for parliamentary monarchy, separation of church and state, reform of the suffrage laws, improvement of the worker\u0027s lot, for liberalizing public education, abolishing slavery wherever it existed, improving the prison system and eliminating poverty. He managed, nevertheless, to stay clear of several more powerful champions of liberal causes such as Lamartine, Royer-Collard, and Thiers, who would have liked to have him on their side but whose egos he mistrusted. Independence is what most characterizes Tocqueville\u0027s career. A colleague reproached him for \"giving the right hand to the left, the left to the right and regretting that he does not have a third one to give invisibly.\" \"Freedom is the strongest of my passions. Voila. It is the truth,\" he explained to disconcerted observers. If he moved left, it was, he claimed, to impose his color on the left, not change his own. Another constant was his hatred of centralization. In \"L\u0027Ancien Regime et la Revolution,\" Tocqueville analyzed the roots of centralization in France, which according to him went as far back as the reign of Philip the Fair in the Middle Ages. He lamented the fact that centralization had destroyed time-tested local organic structures and that the French nobility itself was at fault in the process. Tocqueville fought centralism in all of its manifestations as he saw them. For instance, rather an agnostic himself, he defended religious education because he believed in the healthy necessity of a third force besides the state and the people. Tocqueville\u0027s anticentralism colored his responses to the various colonial enterprises that characterize European history of the period. Thus, in newly conquered Algeria, he favored a kind of settlement based on local autonomy rather than central metropolitan power. He was the first man in the Chamber to push for a separate ministry for Algeria -- a dream that became a fact only a century later in Leon Blum\u0027s cabinet. He deplored the downfall of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, since the Turks were not only a desirable bumper between the major European predators, but also relatively tolerant themselves toward the diversity of their possessions. He admired the respect for local customs that the British had shown in India. Tocqueville was an active, intelligent legislator, esteemed particularly for his work on penitentiary reform (inspired by the Philadelphia system) and on the abolition of slavery, but he was not a sensational figurehead. One might say that, like Montaigne, he had lived through a great deal of political turmoil and managed to preserve an independent judgment. When Louis-Napoleon was propelled into the presidency at the end of the bloody 1848 revolution, Tocqueville was given the foreign affairs ministry in the Barrot cabinet. He served with the same unsensational distinction as in the Chamber but was fired after only five months. He had protested Louis-Napoleon\u0027s coup d\u0027etat that made an emperor of the president and was briefly imprisoned in Vincennes -- luckier in this than one of our great-grandfathers, who was sent to the Sahara for the same offense. From then to his death from tuberculosis in Cannes in 1859, Tocqueville led the life of a gentleman farmer and journalist who, amid numerous changes of residence to accommodate his health, wrote (but did not finish) \"L\u0027Ancien Regime et la Revolution.\" This long and scrupulous study of a man who was one of the most profound and prophetic thinkers of his time, is, alas, scrupulous to the point of boredom. The narration rarely deviates from an inexhaustible concatenation of facts related in the soberest of prose. Although it does justice to Tocqueville\u0027s ideas, it fails in rendering the passion and the grace of his intellectual life and the social brilliance of the era. Moreover, the book is curiously organized: The order followed a mixture of the chronological and of the thematic, with several baffling leaps from one to the other. Andre Jardin\u0027s work constitutes an excellent work of reference for the scholar. It is indexed and substantially but not cumbersomely footnoted. Still it makes the layman yearn for the livelier manner of much recent historical writing.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition PERUVIAN MEMORIES AND THE \u0027SHINING PATH\u0027; TUNGSTEN A NOVEL BY CESAR VALLEJO; TRANSLATED BY ROBERT MEZEY; FOREWORD BY KEVIN J. O\u0027CONNOR (SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 168 PP.; 0-8156-0226-X) Why read \"Tungsten,\" a partisan novel written almost 60 years ago in which evil is unmitigated, virtue unblemished, and the characters seem to lack dimension or complexity as they play out their predetermined roles on the stage of the class struggle? Why read a book in which ideology reigns supreme, and why celebrate its first, belated translation into English? Because the author is Cesar Vallejo, one of the great poets of the 20th Century and a major figure in Latin American literature. Vallejo created a wrenching poetic language for Spanish that radically altered the shape of its imagery and the nature of its rhythms. No facile trend setter, Vallejo forged a new discourse in order to express his own visceral compassion for human suffering. He saw the world in piercing flashes of outrage and anguish, terror and pity, and what he saw wounded him like knife thrusts. A passionate, tragic poet, he mourned our loss of moral innocence and despaired of the injustice that moves the world. In the late 1920s, when he was living in Paris and eking out a meager livelihood as a journalist, the pain at the roots of his being found objective substantiation in radical politics. Born in the Peruvian Andes in 1892, he witnessed firsthand the victimization and exploitation of the South American Indians. Although his own family was not financially destitute (his father was a notary and minor bureaucrat in the small town of Santiago de Chuco), Vallejo was a cholo, a person born of mixed European and Indian ancestry. The fact is not irrelevant. In a society where social and economic status followed the color line with cosmic certainty, where racial discrimination was rigidly adhered to although rarely acknowledged in public, the representatives of foreign companies, with the wholehearted complicity of domestic colleagues, extracted high profits from the near-slavery of the illiterate, utterly alienated and ultimately helpless victims of that racism. Vallejo had ample opportunity to witness the brutalization en masse of the Indian underclass and the appalling greed of their lighter-skinned masters who carried on the colonial tradition of using Indians as forced labor in mines and on plantations. Twentieth-Century writers from Ciro Alegria to Manuel Scorza have denounced the Peruvian tragedy in their books. \"Tungsten\" was one of the earliest novels to do so in modern terms. As a young man, however, Vallejo\u0027s greatest energies were devoted to writing and publishing his poems (\"Los heraldos negros,\" his first book, appeared in 1918); consequently, he remained on the periphery of the windstorms of political and social unrest that swept through South America in the second decade of the century, although he was in the time and place where growing agitation to establish justice for Peruvian Indians and workers began its inexorable march toward Marxism. Vallejo, Jose Carlos Mariategui (the \"Shining Path\" in today\u0027s Peru takes its name from his writings) and Victor Raul Haya de la Torre (a founder of the important APRA movement -- the \"Popular Revolutionary American Alliance\") crossed paths at the university in Trujillo. But Vallejo was an intermittent student. His family began to experience economic difficulties during his adolescence, and he was obliged to interrupt secondary school and then his university studies to take a series of jobs, which included office work in the mines at Tambores and Quiruvilca, and on a large sugar plantation in the Chicama Valley. These facts are not irrelevant either. They provided the historical raw material for \"Tungsten,\" the documented background to Vallejo\u0027s outcry against the grim realities of Indian life in Peru. The shape that material would take -- his conviction that the problem of race was indistinguishable from the problem of class -- was determined by his increasingly active commitment to socialism, a political engagement that, by 1930, led to his expulsion from France, where he had gone to live seven years earlier. The action of the novel is centered in a fictional mining town and its provincial capital, Colca. The time is 1917, just before the U.S. entry into World War I when a ready supply of tungsten would be crucial to the weapons industry. A North American corporation takes over the mine, and the boom is on: Peasants are first lured and then coerced into working for the company, local Indians, the Soras, are cheated of their land and animals, petit bourgeois entrepreneurs scramble on the backs of the poor for wealth and position, and venal officials and dignitaries find a new source of bribery and power-brokering in the foreign capitalists. The first two-thirds of the book, in fact, constitutes a genre study of unashamed thuggery, a series of vignettes of corruption, repression and brutality that sets the stage for the violent heart of \"Tungsten\" and the appearance of its proletarian Indian hero, Servando Huanca. Two Indian boys are forcibly conscripted into military service (the military as well as the mining contractors have \"body quotas\" -- numbers of recruits or workers that must be obtained by any means), and on the long march from their homes to Colca, when they are tied by the waist to the mules that their captors ride, they are so badly abused that one of them eventually dies. Outside the Subprefecture an angry crowd gathers, indignant at the visible signs of the conscripts\u0027 mistreatment. One defiant man, Servando Huanca, steps forward to speak for the crowd with natural authority and an instinctive class consciousness. These qualities inspire the people and momentarily cow the authorities, but then the troops are ordered to fire into the crowd, and later that night officially sanctioned vigilantes pursue any Indian they can find, shooting to kill. Some, however, are taken into custody, and deals are struck by sleazy officials which allow the prisoners to be sent off to a sure death in the mines to help fulfill the company\u0027s \"body quota.\" Last and certainly least, the third section of the book is a kind of postscript to the Colca massacre. Vallejo allows his indignation and passion to turn into mechanical ideology: Servando Huanca \"duckspeaks\" a mercifully brief exercise in orthodoxy, proclaiming that world revolution is under way, that it will be led by a militant proletariat inspired by Lenin and not by bourgeois \"intellectuals,\" that it will sweep away the ruling classes in Peru. Vallejo even permits the novel to end with this ponderously symbolic sentence: \"Outside, the wind was rising, portending storm.\" Kevin J. O\u0027Connor has written a thoughtful and informative foreword, Robert Mezey has done a fine job of translating Vallejo\u0027s often quirky Spanish, and both of them deserve our gratitude for their sensitivity and skill in bringing the work to the attention of an English-language audience. I am sorry that I cannot say as much for the editing. The typographical errors are frequent and unforgivable, and there is no indication as one reads that Mezey has provided important end notes to the text. This is a disservice to the reader; Vallejo and his translator deserve better.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition EXTINCT IN THE LAND OF FIRE; WHO WILL REMEMBER THE PEOPLE BY JEAN RASPAIL; TRANSLATED BY JEREMY LEGGATT (MERCURY HOUSE: $18.95; 215 PP.) The four tribes of the now-extinct native Americans that once inhabited the Tierra del Fuego archipelago -- that ships\u0027 graveyard along the land\u0027s end, southern tip of South America -- were among the most primitive and hardy peoples encountered in the New World. In this fine piece of historical fiction cum-exemplary story, French novelist Jean Raspail explores the sad fate of the Alacalufs (who called themselves Kaweskar, \"The People\"), the lesser known of the two tribes of sea-nomads or \"canoe Indians.\" Raspail reconstructs the history of the Alacalufs through their own eyes and those of Magellan, Drake and other historical figures. In this noble quest of the \"other\" (those whose languages and customs seemed so alien to Europeans that they refused to admit that they belonged to the human species), the view from \"within\" is attempted through a synopsis of generations, of millennia, in the mind of the character Lafko, a kind of collective memory of the Alacalufs. The view from \"without\" reveals a shameful history of smug disdain: From Magellan on, Europeans judged the Alacalufs to be \"ugly,\" \"stinking,\" \"disgusting,\" \"brutish,\" \"beasts,\" \"animals\"; they kidnaped them, enslaved them and, at worst, their genocidal instincts unleashed, they turned their guns and cannons on them for sport, exterminated them; in the end, they were hunted for bounty or herded into missionary stations where they died of white man\u0027s diseases or the despair of captivity, and the last stragglers were reduced to bartering and begging in the shipping lanes of the Strait of Magellan. The complicity of scientists (like Darwin) in fostering this outcome is addressed in a couple of the chapters. The other side of the coin -- that our survival, too, depends on our ability to embrace others not as a function of our own ideal but of theirs -- is seen in the tragic fate of the inhabitants of Name of Jesus and the City of King Philip, Spain\u0027s first settlement communities in Tierra del Fuego,who went mad or starved to death. The English privateer Cavendish rechristened the latter city Port Famine. The point is brought home in the moving chapter, \"A Civilized Gentleman.\" Sir John Byron, shipwrecked in the Strait in his youth and rescued by the Alacalufs, returns to the scene years later and ponders the legacy of European contacts: \"What an endless history of contempt is unraveled! And yet . . . .\" An instinct for survival had not saved his fellow castaways. He alone had survived by crossing the cultural abyss and living with the Alacaluf clan for six months, and the clan had braved the seas and their fears of the world beyond their territory to set him down on an island from which Chilotan seal hunters returned him to Puerto Montt. But when Raspail attempts to give us a glimpse from within (the inner life of the Alacalufs), the reader is aware of a European mind wedged between him and the \"other.\" The Alacalufs are \"endlessly fleeing,\" \"forsaken\" pariahs, \"commanded by fate to survive, not to live\" in a land shrouded in \"an eternally black sky,\" \"a witches\u0027 dance of cruel winds,\" \"a hell of snow and winds.\" But this area is also stunningly beautiful, and Father Martin Gusinde has compared the Yamana, a sister tribe, to \u0027fidgety birds of passage who were happy and inwardly calm only when they were on the move\u0027). In two recent works, Bruce Chatwin (\"The Songlines\") and Mario Vargas Llosa (\"El Hablador\" (\"The Speaker\") ) convincingly draw the reader into the soul-life, the Earth-bound myths and legends of the Australian Bushmen and the Peruvian Machiguengas, respectively. Raspail is far less successful in a parallel attempt with the Alacalufs, and the fault is not in Jeremy Leggatt\u0027s translation, which is excellent. Despite that limitation, Raspail\u0027s story, inscribed in the dialogue of cultures so characteristic of our age, is a fine version in historical fiction of a true story loud with ethical reverberations. As First-World nations, we are collectively responsible for the fate of colonized and subjugated peoples in the Third World, but we have hardly begun to address those responsibilities.",

Clements, a journalist, wrote \"Rock Me\" in part to evoke the lives of the musicians she first met at New York City\u0027s High School of Music and Art and then toured with in a yearlong stint as one of Fagen\u0027s backup singers. On this level, \"Rock Me\" is absorbing and believable. Casey and Michael, Clements\u0027 protagonists, are accurate portrayals of 1960s rockers grappling with the late 1980s. Up on shrinks, down on drugs (after years of riding high) and longing for friendship though often sidetracked by lust, they speak in a delightfully spacey dialect from somewhere in between the San Fernando Valley and the New School for Social Research: \"It\u0027s just been a horrible grind for so long,\" Casey tells Michael, \"that now I have this, like, unbelievable negative tropism about all of it.\" Sometimes Clements\u0027 language, with no evidence of satire, strays from the eccentric to the insipid. \"You really have a great tan,\" Casey tells Michael. \"I hope so,\" he responds. \"Because that\u0027s all I have.\" Clements\u0027 point of view is also stylistically problematic, changing from first to third person for no apparent reason. A final problem is Clements\u0027 attempt to study a love triangle. Casey, the burnt-out lead singer in a highly successful band, leaves New York City to recuperate in Hawaii. There, she meets Michael, her former lover and band partner, and his girlfriend Leslie. Sensing the desire between Casey and Michael, Leslie, hardly monogamous herself, sanctions an affair between the two. Casey and Michael eventually make love, but rather than confronting her feelings toward Michael, Casey abruptly returns to New York, riddled with guilt over her \"dirty deed.\" Clements\u0027 portrait of Casey, nevertheless, is an intimate and credible sketch of a neurotic artist. Casey returns to New York confused, but creatively reinvigorated, concluding that she can only realize her fantasies in her music: \"The best affair is the affair you don\u0027t have . . . except in your songs.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition MEMORIES OF A CHINESE-AMERICAN BOYHOOD; THE CHINAMAN PACIFIC \u0026 FRISCO R.R. CO. BY FRANK CHIN (COFFEE HOUSE PRESS: $9.95; 184 PP.) When I think of some friends of mine from the old neighborhood (all of whom had the proper ethnic credentials, let me assure you), one thing I remember is our wariness of what we called \"I Have a Problem\" literature. By that, we meant literature of ethnic experience at its most tiresome: brooding, Angst-ridden story-polemics, crammed to the gills with resentment and righteous anger, about existential misery in the Land of the Round-Eye; literature that seemed to assume that any bit of drivel was worth your attention just as long as it had a chip on its shoulder. It\u0027s a species related to what Calvin Trillin called the \"kvetch novel\" -- any novel in which you want to say to the main character, \"Oh, just pull up your socks\" -- only more irritating. But it\u0027s also an easy trap for anyone who writes from an ethnocentric point of view to fall into. It is, therefore, to Frank Chin\u0027s credit that his collection of short stories, \"The Chinaman Pacific \u0026 Frisco R.R. Co.\" by and large avoids this trap even as it dances on the edge of the pit. There are eight stories in this volume, most of them autobiographical in tone. Almost all have as their essential subject the alienation of Chinese-America from the America of white skin and Wonder Bread. The first two, \"Railroad Standard Time\" and \"The Eat and Run Midnight People,\" read like meandering stream-of-consciousness memoirs and are self-indulgent enough to make them the weakest of the bunch. The final story, \"The Sons of Chan,\" clothes itself in shreds of fiction with some interesting Freudian overtones, but it is otherwise a tiring screed on growing up with the stereotypes in Charlie Chan movies as your only reflection in popular culture. Chin\u0027s rhetoric is often sharp and funny, but he also rides the high horse of racial bitterness for more than it\u0027s worth. It\u0027s the other five stories that distinguish \"The Chinaman Pacific \u0026 Frisco R.R. Co.\" In them, Chin displays two considerable writerly virtues. One is a wicked sense of humor that runs a provocative gamut from jangled whimsy to scathing satire. His subject matter is weighty enough so that an amusing conceit or figuration often balances out the mood. This is particularly true of \"A Chinese Lady Dies,\" in which the narrator\u0027s problematic (and disturbingly Oedipal) relationship with his mother evokes such tension that the story would self-immolate without the whimsical dream passages in which he imagines himself as an Old-Western hero called E. Chino. His wit feels more like a dagger than a feather, but is no less amusing for it. And for good measure, Chin tacks on an afterword that reads suspiciously like a freewheeling satire on Maxine Hong Kingston\u0027s \"The Woman Warrior.\" His other primary virtue is his considerable skill as a storyteller. He has a genuine gift for bringing characters and their predicaments alive. One sees this most vividly in \"The Only Real Day,\" which focuses on the struggle of an aged immigrant to keep American culture at bay and preserve his identity as a Chinese. Chin has a definite point to make in this story about the corrosion of Chinese values and identity in a mostly white world, but the message is filtered so thoroughly through the plot and well-drawn characters that it has no didactic harshness. It is, above all, a poignant and entrancing piece of fiction. \"Yes, Young Daddy,\" which depicts the protagonist\u0027s relationship with a female cousin who is grappling with adolescence, is also worth noting for its skillful portraiture. Chin\u0027s prose style tends toward a looseness vaguely reminiscent of William S. Burroughs. It\u0027s lively stuff but also slow going at times, what with the missing antecedents, plastic sentence structure and all. He also enjoys playing fast and loose with temporal shifts in his stories, with the result that memory, present experience, anticipation and pure fantasy often overlap. It\u0027s an absorbingly dense reflection of the way in which past, present and future come to bear upon each other in the mind, but everything melds so seamlessly that the reader may have some trouble keeping things sorted. On the whole, Chin does a good job of avoiding the hazards that could have swallowed up these stories. Although alienation is the great theme of post-World War II American literature and our age is distinguished by its voices from outside the mainstream, just because a work is about racial alienation doesn\u0027t automatically make it worth reading. The problem with ethnocentric literature is that its force is so centripetal. It tends to reach inward, instead of outward toward the universal significance that, as Northrop Frye said, marks literature in its highest form. Fiction need not reach that level to be worth our while, but it should at least show a human dimension that will move us and provoke us, as mere formalized pique cannot. Fortunately, \"The Chinaman Pacific \u0026 Frisco R.R. Co.\" achieves such transcendance often enough to make it worthwhile fiction.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition MOVIES OF THE WEEK The Sunday evening movie lineup is one of the strongest in memory, commencing at 6 p.m. on Channel 5 with Mel Brooks\u0027 hilarious 1974 horror picture spoof, Young Frankenstein, with Gene Wilder heading a terrific cast. Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner, traces the parallel lives of two very different athletes who became part of the remarkable British track and field team at the 1924 Olympics. Silent Victory: The Kitty O\u0027Neil Story (Channel 9 Sunday at 7 p.m.) is an exceptionally well-made 1979 TV movie with Stockard Channing starring in this real-life story about a deaf woman who became one of Hollywood\u0027s top stunt women. If anything, Mel Brooks\u0027 1968 debut film The Producers (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is even funnier than \"Young Frankenstein.\" It\u0027s a zany farce in which Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder come up with a cockamamie scheme to profit from staging a terrible play. The 1972 Frenzy (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is the finest of Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s last films, a thriller set in his native London and dealing with a man (Jon Finch) wrongly accused of being a serial killer. The Karen Carpenter Story (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Cynthia Gibb in the title role of this new TV movie about the popular singer who died at 32 from the affects of anorexia nervosa. Mitchell Anderson plays Carpenter\u0027s brother and singing partner Richard. The 1984 Gremlins (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is Frank Capra\u0027s \"It\u0027s a Wonderful Life\" turned inside out, upside down and pickled in brine, a sweet-and-sour comedy featuring an invasion of a small Middle American town by a horde of fast-multiplying, deceptively cute, furry creatures. The 14th James Bond adventure A View to a Kill (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a so-so affair, with Roger Moore beginning to look a little weary as 007 (Timothy Dalton would replace him in the next Bond, the 1987 \"Living Daylights\"). This time the villain is Christopher Walken, intent on destroying Silicon Valley. Watching Terry Gilliam\u0027s 1985 Brazil (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), an exploding cigar in the face of the future, is like watching Gilliam\u0027s head erupt in public. Everything that has ever made an impact on the film maker seems to be whirling by in this brilliant, exhausting, savagely funny post-Orwellian satire, set in the gray confines of the Ministry of Information where his shiningly innocent hero (Jonathan Pryce) toils in his cherished anonymity. Gilliam\u0027s targets are the usual Monty Python concerns: modern technology and the men who run it, terrorists, repairmen, bureaucrats, the plastic surgery industry, the ad game and sticklers for detail, wherever they are. Terror on Highway 91 (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars Ricky Schroder in the true story of a young man who exposes police corruption in a small southern town. George Dzundza and Matt Clark co-star. Blake Edwards\u0027 1979 10 (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 10 p.m.), a modern comedy classic, stars Dudley Moore as a popular composer who, in the clutch of middle age, pursues a beautiful young bride (Bo Derek) all the way to Mexico, where she is honeymooning. This is a superbly constructed film which makes shrewd observations of the American obsession with sex and youth, California-style. The Man in the Brown Suit (CBS Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie updating Agatha Christie\u0027s 1924 mystery novel about a young American woman (Stephanie Zimbalist) traveling through Egypt in search of adventure. Rue McClanahan, Tony Randall and Edward Woodward star. Rob Reiner\u0027s 1984 This Is Spinal Tap (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) is one of the funniest movies of the decade, a delicious sendup on the making of a rock documentary in which Reiner casts himself as a film maker trying to make a record of a seedy English group on tour. The line between parody and reality becomes exceedingly and riotously thin. The dreadful 1986 comedy Armed and Dangerous (CBS Saturday at 8 p.m.) plays like a third-generation dupe print of \"Police Academy,\" with frantic splices from \"Beverly Hills Cop.\" John Candy and Eugene Levy star as a pair of goofy misfits adrift in a Los Angeles populated entirely by bozos, nitwits, boobs and cads.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition PICTURING MANZANAR; MANZANAR BY JOHN ARMOUR AND PETER WRIGHT PHOTOGRAPHS BY ANSEL ADAMS, COMMENTARY BY JOHN HERSEY (TIMES BOOKS: $27.50; 167 PP.) There could not be a more powerful combination than words by John Hersey and photographs by Ansel Adams. When the subject matter is \"Manzanar\" and the unconstitutional imprisoning of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the combination would seem to be explosive -- and is. Eloquent and moving, Hersey\u0027s 15,000-word essay details how this tragedy came into being: \"The bitterest national shame of the Second World War for the sweet land of liberty: the mass incarceration, on racial grounds alone, on false evidence of military necessity, and in contempt of their supposedly inalienable rights, of an entire class of American citizens -- along with others who were not citizens in the country of their choice only because that country had long denied people of their race the right to naturalize.\" Equally moving are Adams\u0027 photographs, originally taken to document life in Manzanar, just a speck on the map in Inyo County in the rugged eastern Sierra before it became one of 10 camps established to hold about 120,000 Japanese-Americans from 1942 to 1945. Unfortunately, Hersey\u0027s contribution occupies only the first 66 pages. Worse, Adams\u0027 pictures have been culled to less than half of the 204 pictures he donated to the Library of Congress. Many of these historic photographs are reproduced at sizes much smaller than snapshots developed in a hour at your corner photo shop. Instead of letting Hersey and Adams\u0027 words and pictures tell the story, the book dilutes the saga and turns it into another stereotypical tale of Japanese-Americana: how we overcame hardship and made the best of a bad situation. The titles of the three different contributions to the book indicate three different approaches: outrage in Hersey\u0027s \"A Mistake of Terrifically Horrible Proportions,\" irony in Adams\u0027 \"Born Free and Equal\" and the bland in Armour and Wright\u0027s \"A Portrait of Manzanar.\" Now that a redress bill has been passed by Congress and signed by the President, which would grant every living internee $20,000, the horrifying mistake of nearly 50 years ago has been officially rectified. But not the lasting impression that what the government did was wrong. For chipping away at this stone wall the book\u0027s authors and publisher have to be congratulated. But how much better it would have been for the book to at least mention that Ansel Adams\u0027 Manzanar photos, when put on display after 40 years, were criticized by some Japanese-Americans as \"prettifying\" the harsh camp experience. Or that many of those photographed carry hidden pyschological scars from the war fought within. Or that most of those photographed have long since died, never qualifying for the $20,000 and carrying to their graves the thought that they were \"guilty\" as never charged.",

Jean-Baptiste Marchand sails from Marseilles to the French Congo and begins his trek across Africa to the Nile with 150-odd Senegalese soldiers. They arrive in Fashoda in July, 1898. In the meantime, the British launch an Anglo-Egyptian army of 30,000 men under the leadership of Herbert Kitchener. These men build a railroad across the desert, meet up with another 60,000-man army and arrive in Fashoda in September, 1898. \"On September 19, Marchand and Kitchener exchanged champagne toasts aboard a British gunboat anchored off Fashoda before politely threatening to destroy each other,\" David Levering Lewis writes in this absorbing history. \"On November 4, Paris ordered recently promoted Major Marchand to abandon his fortress.\" Drawing from the archives of African states, from newly translated political correspondence as well as memoirs, Lewis exposes the sometimes absurd imperial energies of European states and the emerging role of African nations.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition ART NEWS: AN EXHIBIT WHOSE TIME HAS COME Phyllis Plous admits that six years is a long time to put together any exhibit. Her timing seems auspicious, however. When the curator began organizing a show of abstract painting in 1982, in her words, the art form was \"relegated to the dust bins.\" Today, as \"Abstract Options\" is about to open, that is all changed. \"There\u0027s been a definite acceleration of interest in abstraction since the mid-\u002780s,\" said Plous, who with Frances Colpitt co-curated the 32-painting exhibit, opening Friday at UC Santa Barbara\u0027s University Art Museum. The project began when Colpitt, a critic and art historian, arrived at UCSB to teach, said Plous, University Art Museum curator. \"Neo Expressionism was so rampant at the time and we began to wonder why we only saw Abstract art in artists\u0027 studios.\" Ten contemporary artists from the east and west coasts are represented in the show. The co-curators chose artists that differed in their treatment of surface and form, but shared a preference for a lush richness. \"The show perhaps is about sensuality and the process of painting,\" Plous said. \"Unlike Neo-Geo, this is not dry illustrative abstraction. I don\u0027t like the word pretty very much, but I think it\u0027s going to be a beautiful show.\" Artists in the exhibit are Edith Baumann-Hudson, Moira Dryer, Heidi Gluck, Nancy Haynes, James Hayward, Mary Heilmann, Julian Lethbridge, John M. Miller, Paul Mogensen and Stephen Westfall. It is scheduled to run in Santa Barbara through Feb. 26, then travel to Evanston, Ill., and Santa Clara, Calif. RETIRING: Artist La Monte Westmoreland, who established Los Angeles\u0027 most active high school-based gallery, will retire this month to concentrate on his own artwork after 10 years as director of Roberts Art Gallery at Santa Monica High School. \"I just need to have more studio time,\" Westmoreland said, now making mostly mixed-media collages shown at Lizardi/Harp Gallery in Pasadena. Lita Albuquerque, John Swihart, Laddie John Dill, Guy Dill and Sandra Mendelson Rubin lead an illustrious list of local artists, many of them alumni of the high school, who regularly took part in Westmoreland\u0027s exhibits. Santa Monica-based artist Peter Alexander, who for several years donated works for annual auctions to support the gallery, lauded Westmoreland\u0027s efforts that he said turned the space, founded in 1935, into a unique showcase for local emerging and established artists that particularly benefited the high school\u0027s students. \"The whole deal was La Monte\u0027s doing,\" said Alexander, one of this city\u0027s best-known painters whose two daughters went to Santa Monica High School. \"His enthusiasm, in terms of bringing work to the students, has been quite extraordinary.\" Ann Goodwin, a painting instructor at the high school, will succeed Westmoreland, whose final exhibit, \"Paintings and Sculptures,\" Jan. 5 through Jan. 26, features eight artists. (See art openings for details.) LACE GRANTS: Local interdisciplinary artists developing new work may apply for grants from Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), now in the fourth year of its Grant Program for Interdisciplinary Artists. More than $30,200 are available for individuals or groups of artists working collaboratively. For information and an application, call LACE at (213) 624-5650. June Scott heads up the program. IN PUBLIC: Public art and its preservation, issues of increasing concern nationwide, are the theme of a new publication. \"Going Public: A Field Guide to Developments in Art in Public Places\" was produced with the input of 30 nationally recognized artists, public art administrators, design professionals and others brought together by the National Endowment for the Arts to examine public art issues. For information, contact the Arts Education Service at the University of Massachusetts, (413) 545-2360.",

A new catalogue of chicken-based products available from Pierce Foods -- a leading supplier of pre-cooked menu items to the food service industry -- offers well over 200 variations on the theme. There\u0027s Hume Dingher\u0027s 39 Seasonings Fast-Fry chicken, for instance (\"Leave it to Hume to pack 39 herbs and spices, sea salts, and vegetables into one chicken recipe\"). Or Greek Odyssey Chicken Breast Fillets (\"IT\u0027S MICROWAVEABLE!\"). Or Marinata Americana Chicken Thigh Fillets (\"Here is a chicken fillet with a touch of greatness -- a lighter blend of those Central and Southern European spices America loves best\"). Other varieties of Pierce poulet include Marinata/LS (Low Sodium) Curried Brest (sic), Microwaveable Wing-Dings, Roman-Fingers, Dip\u0027n Chik\u0027n Nuggets, Taste O\u0027Mesquite Whole Halves (sic), Chik-Nachos and both Whirligigs and Whirlibirds (the latter, of course, being \"Fully cooked, breaded chicken breast-and-thigh meat patties . . . seasoned with sage and onion croutons\").

READ MY LICKS: What will (gulp) President Bush and Vice-President Quayle be eating on the evening of Inauguration Day? Hearts-of-palm blossoms, asiago-garlic bread and pheasant pizza, among other things. They\u0027ll be sampling these and other exotic delicacies at a reception in a new restaurant in the nation\u0027s capital called Adirondacks. Adirondacks, which is the work of L.A.\u0027s own Michael McCarty (of Michael\u0027s in Santa Monica) and chef Jimmy Schmidt -- who also own the Rattlesnake Clubs in Denver and Detroit -- is an appropriate site for a presidential reception, as it happens, since it occupies the old presidential suite at Washington\u0027s Union Station, built for the use of Teddy Roosevelt. (Adirondacks was originally going to be yet another Rattlesnake Club, incidentally, but McCarty and Schmidt felt that an East-coast sort of name would be more appropriate. Personally, I think the Rattlesnake Club is a great name for a restaurant a few blocks from Capitol Hill.) \"We\u0027re just going to serve wild hors d\u0027oeuvres,\" says Schmidt. \"You know those politician types. They like to stay on their feet and pump a lot of hands. They\u0027ll probably be so busy talking that they\u0027ll only take little bites of things -- so I\u0027ve got to get my licks in quick.\" Among those licks will be spicy shrimp with achiote and picaya (hearts-of-palm blossoms) on lemon-bread croutons, asiago-garlic bread with black and green olive tapenade, and that pheasant pizza with the addition of Chinese-style plum sauce, hot mustard and mozzarella. Hey, wait a minute. Isn\u0027t Bush the guy who made fun of Michael Dukakis for talking about Belgian endive?

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition PASTIMES: AROUND HOME; STENCILING SUDDENLY POPULAR after nearly a century of neglect, stencil painting now decorates nursery walls and furniture, living and dining room walls and floors. Stenciling became prominent in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was used to imitate wallpaper. In the American colonies, stenciled designs were used on floors, on furniture and on canvas or oilcloth floor coverings. The process is simple: A stenciler, using a craft knife, cuts various shapes in a piece of sturdy, usually waxed, paper, and then applies paint to a surface through those cutouts. The beauty of stenciling is the ease of repetition: Complicated swag-and-bouquet borders can be applied to walls in a fraction of the time (and without the requisite talent) it would take someone to paint them by hand. Stenciling can be a very satisfying craft, because the end result, when done well, looks professionally neat and precise. Although stenciling is easy enough to attempt on your own -- with just some paper, a craft knife, paint and brushes -- a small test project before launching into a total-room experience is a good idea. The hardest thing to master is the correct consistency of the paint. Think dry. And the stencil brush (shaped like a blunt, long-handled shaving brush) should be wielded with an up-and-down motion; wiping brings disaster. The surface to be stenciled determines the consistency of the paint; cloth can take more paint on the brush, but a floor previously painted with something like diamond-hard deck enamel will resist all paint. Many how-to books on stenciling have been published; Dover Books has issued a series of books of stencil designs on thick paper, ready for cutting. Stenciling supplies and classes are offered at Judy\u0027s Carousel Crafts and Rainbow Craft, both in Burbank, and at Craf-T-Mac\u0027s in La Habra. Supplies are available at Aaron Bros. stores, Kit Kraft in Studio City, Stat\u0027s in Pasadena, and Michael\u0027s in Torrance. UCLA Extension plans to offer a stenciling class in the spring quarter.",

It is not digital audio tape that is un-American, but rather the Recording Industry Assn. of America itself. The attitudes and actions of the RIAA very closely parallel those of the Luddites, the early 19th-Century English workmen who destroyed labor-saving machinery to \"protect\" the economy. The Luddites could not see that if textiles could be more easily manufactured and sold for less, more people could afford more of them. In the same way, the RIAA was wrong about standard audio cassettes, wrong about videocassette recorders and now also wrong about DAT. Audio cassettes boosted sales of long-playing records, and VCRs boosted motion picture revenues. The RIAA would like to punish the entire country for the supposed wrongs of the proverbial bootlegging pirates. This is not only unfair but ludicrous. The RIAA\u0027s special-interest politicking may have hurt the introduction of DAT, but it won\u0027t be able to stop read/write compact discs. Everything seems to be going digital.

How can business leaders and economic policy-makers improve the economy and the world in general in 1989? The Times ran these questions by people in various walks of life, and here are some of their answers: Muriel Siebert, head of the Muriel Siebert \u0026 Co. discount brokerage in New York, and first female member of the New York Stock Exchange: \"I would like to see certain business practices regulated. I think that the leveraged buyouts show the greed of people at their worst. . . . The LBOs are bypassing the purpose of the capital-raising system. I think that to the extent that people were stockholders in these companies . . . they should be allowed to continue to have some kind of share in the profits (after the leveraged buyouts) because these moves were done while they were stockholders. \"Must greed be the creed? I would like to see that also rolled over to our defense contractors. I am pro defense. I believe in a strong country because people mistake gentility for weakness. If (contractors) cheat on defense contracts, I don\u0027t see why they don\u0027t go to jail. . . . I just feel that if you are a major defense contractor, you owe a fiduciary responsibility to this country because defense expenditures are putting a pretty big toll on the country.\" Andrew Brimmer, former member of the Federal Reserve Board and head of a Washington economics consulting firm: \"My leading wish is that the nation deal with the federal budget deficit. I would like to see a substantial reduction in 1989 and extending over the next three years. I would strongly recommend that we raise taxes. There should be some moderation in the level of government expenditures, but the real problem is the lag in revenue. \"I also would like to see more done for education by business. The kind of education I\u0027m talking about is at the elementary and secondary level. Businesses are already contributing to colleges. Businesses should do likewise for elementary and secondary schools. Business people can play a role as counselors and teachers. A firm might make available an engineer or mathematician to go into schools and teach. Business should do more to offer on-the-job training for unskilled, or limited-skills, people, perhaps through a (lower) learning wage. We would give business tax credits to do this.\" William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO: \"I would like to see a change in philosophy by the incoming President relating to labor relations and providing for fairness in our (labor) organizing efforts and contract negotiations. . . . \"I would also like to see some protection for workers losing their jobs because of mergers. It is a national disgrace. In too many mergers, the workers are the ones that suffer and the country as well. Something should be done to correct it. . . . \"And, finally, this Administration should face reality in resolving the astronomical deficit.\" Steven D. Lydenberg, an associate with the \"socially responsible\" investment firm of Franklin Research \u0026 Development: \"There is an increasing interest around the country in social investing. People want to know not just the financial implications of making a commitment in a company, but also the social implication. That information is not very easy to come by. \"So, if at the end of \u002789 corporations were disclosing in a uniform way their yield figures, their charitable contribution figures, the numbers of women and minorities in top management and board directors, their attitude on a number of comparable social issues, I would be very happy.\" Frank Borman, chairman of Patlex Corp. of Chatsworth, former astronaut and former chairman of Eastern Airlines: \"We should begin to move toward taxing consumption -- a value-added tax. This is quite controversial as Al Ullman (Oregon Democrat and former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who was defeated in 1988 after advocating a value-added tax) will tell you. But this taxing system is needed. It would certainly help our exports. Almost all of Europe is under the value-added taxing system. Also, it may encourage saving instead of consumption. One of the ways you discourage consumption is to tax it.\" Michael Harrington, co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America and author of \"The Other America\" and \"The New American Poverty\": \"I hope Secretary of State Baker will build on the basic insights of former Treasury Secretary Baker (James Baker, former treasury secretary, was nominated by President-elect Bush to be Secretary of State) that a settlement of Third World debt is in the self-interest of America, opening up markets for business and labor. But then the new Baker will have to go far beyond the old, since Latin America now owes more than it did in 1982 when the crisis officially began, and several countries, including Argentina and Brazil, may see democracy subverted if current trends persist. \"At home, the nation must recognize that we can\u0027t waste young people, and particularly minorities and women, on illiteracy, unemployment and unproductive low-wage work. We must invest mightily in education, training and job generation.\" Alan Bromberg, a securities law expert and professor at Southern Methodist University: \"There are several things I would like most to see changed in the economy and business practices. One, more concentration by business and government, both here and abroad, on . . . the facilitation of international trade and investment. This would require wider horizons for business people . . . and more effort by government to reduce and ultimately eliminate all kinds of restrictions on the movement of products. \"Two, I would like to see a national consensus developed, preferably in the form of federal legislation, on corporate takeovers and buyouts that would recognize the efficiencies and benefits they bring as well as the dislocations and hardships they can cause. This would involve tax policies and labor polices and limitations on the ability of states to Balkanize corporate law by different anti-takeover statutes everywhere. (There also should be) some kind of limitation on management self-entrenchment and self-enrichment. \"I think we could use a lot of clarification of the securities laws. I think the courts have done a good job of saying what insider trading is. The kind of issues that are most difficult are what really is parking (of stock)? How much cooperation or similar action by different individuals or different groups of individuals makes it collaboration? These issues haven\u0027t been well resolved. . . . Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in Washington: \"People now view threats to human security less in terms of political threats and more in environmental and economic terms. So for my wish list, I would ask first that we deal with the issue of the greenhouse effect. We better develop some alternative views in mass transportation and cut subsidies to reflect the true cost of fossil fuels in terms of pollution, along with the actual economic cost of development. Then, we could put more money into research and development of wind and solar energy. \"(Also on my wish list is) peace on earth. If we want peace on earth, we have to start looking seriously at the fact that we are making more and more weapons, and in a process which endangers the health of American people. . . . Production plants have been proven to have released into the air and water radioactivity and toxic chemicals.\" \"Also, it would be nice if we could learn that the rain forest affects all of us. We need to preserve it. And we would like the tuna industry to stop killing dolphins.\"",

Most furnishings are also being donated to the $500,000 renovation of the 8,000-square-foot center. Design applications will include the use of brightly colored accents on walls and floors, improved overhead lighting to reduce glare, lighting in handrails and heavily textured walls, said Jan Bast, the chairman of the ASID design team. \"To call this a center for the blind is somewhat a misnomer, since most of the people utilizing the center are partially sighted,\" Bast added. Nearly 80% of the 2,200 people using the San Diego facility are elderly, and design efforts have also gone into special furnishings for that group.

But George Bush will have to pay the price for the Reagan Revolution. We know there won\u0027t be a Bush Revolution because, with one exception, none of the people Bush has appointed to policy-making positions is a revolutionary. They are in the mold of Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, who was reviled by conservatives when he was Ronald Reagan\u0027s chief of staff; Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh, who has served in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who is closer to Wall Street than to the supply-siders on the Republican right, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush\u0027s national security adviser, who is known to harbor serious doubts about Reagan\u0027s \"Star Wars\" program. In other words, Bush has assembled a team of cautious, moderate, pragmatic, Establishment Republicans. The one exception is Jack Kemp, Bush\u0027s proposed secretary of housing and urban development. Kemp has never held an executive position before, and he is brimming over with radical new ideas. Kemp\u0027s is regarded as a token appointment to a secondary Cabinet position, however, made to mollify the GOP\u0027s right wing. (Quiz: Who is Reagan\u0027s secretary of housing and urban development? Hint: He is the only Cabinet member who served for Reagan\u0027s entire two terms. Give up? Here\u0027s another hint: He is the only black in Reagan\u0027s Cabinet. Still stumped? The answer is Samuel R. Pierce Jr. If you didn\u0027t know, don\u0027t worry. Reagan himself didn\u0027t recognize Pierce at a White House reception several years ago.) Actually, radical new ideas are what is needed for dealing with the major problem under Kemp\u0027s purview, namely, the national scandal of homelessness. Other than Kemp, the only controversial appointments Bush has made were to political rather than policy-making positions -- John H. Sununu as White House chief of staff, Lee Atwater as Republican Party chairman and Dan Quayle as vice president. None has to be confirmed by the Senate. And the Bush people are still trying to figure out something for Quayle to do. Otherwise, when it comes to policy positions, there are no James P. Watts, no William J. Caseys, no Edwin Meese IIIs, no William J. Bennetts. The Reagan Administration gave us bold new ideas. The Bush Administration will give us something we rarely got from Reagan -- professionalism. Congress seems impressed by Bush\u0027s professionalism. Even Democrats express admiration for the professionalism of his presidential campaign. \"It was a nasty campaign,\" said House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced), \"but basically it was a professional campaign. They knew what had to be done and they did it.\" Right now, we are in one of the rare periods of make-nice in Washington. Bush\u0027s efforts to bind up the wounds of the campaign are paying off. He has bought himself a honeymoon. Conservatives are holding their fire; they don\u0027t want to be seen as abandoning the new President before he even takes office. The press is happy because the President-elect has held more press conferences this year than the President. Congress and Bush are engaged in an elaborate Alphonse-and-Gaston routine. Each side expresses great admiration for the other. One says, \"Oh please, you be the first to reveal your budget plans.\" \"Oh no, I couldn\u0027t possibly,\" says the other. \"Please, you go first.\" As in the court of the Sun King at Versailles, the ritual courtesy masks a deadly clash of ambitions. Each side wants to seize the dagger and drive it into the other\u0027s heart. Taxes are the dagger. He who proposes new taxes gets it in the neck. As Sen. John Breaux (D-La.), the new chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, put it, \"Bush is the one who laid down the gauntlet -- read my lips, no new taxes. If we go out and break his promise for him, we get the blame for it and he gets the credit. No one wants to fall into that trap.\" In other words, as soon as the deficit comes up, the honeymoon ends. It will be hard for Bush to do what Reagan has done for the last eight years, namely, pretend the deficit is not his problem. Bush will also pay the price for Reagan\u0027s foreign policy. In this case, a break with the Republican right is inevitable. The right always resented the fact that Reagan abandoned his \"evil empire\" agenda in order to pursue arms control and detente. They dared not protest, however. \"Reagan could always go over our heads to our own people at the grass roots,\" said conservative activist Paul Weyrich. \"Bush won\u0027t be able to do that. He needs us.\" Bush and Scowcroft do not show much enthusiasm for \"Star Wars.\" Bush and Baker have decided to postpone asking Congress for new military aid to the Contras. The Reagan Administration, with Bush\u0027s full support, has begun talking to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Some time this year, conservatives are going to say, \"Enough!\" Bush will also pay the price for Reagan\u0027s social agenda. Here the break will be not with Congress or the GOP right, but with the American public. It will happen as soon as the Supreme Court reverses its historic 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that defined abortion as a constitutionally protected human right. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote Roe vs. Wade, has warned that abortion rights may soon \"go down the drain.\" Four of the nine current Supreme Court justices want to overturn the Roe decision, and three of Roe\u0027s supporters are in their 80s. Roe will go. And when that happens, all hell will break loose. \"Taking away rights that have already been given is a hard thing to pull off,\" said Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League. Millions of American women have had abortions. Despite increased restrictions, the abortion rate has remained steady at 1.5 million a year during the Reagan years. A decision recriminalizing abortion will be as divisive for Republicans as the 1954 school desegregation decision was for Democrats. Reagan was lucky. He demanded an end to abortions but it didn\u0027t happen on his watch. Bush won\u0027t be so lucky.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition MIXING SIGNALS ON CAPITOL GRIDLOCK Go-o-o-d morning, Sacramento! Californians have some New Year\u0027s resolutions to propose: -- Balance Proposition 103\u0027s attack on soaring insurance premiums with curbs on claim costs and attorney fees. -- Take responsibility for restructuring the Gann spending limit to fit current budget realities and quit bucking tough fiscal decisions to the voters. -- Address the issues raised by the FBI sting, initiative mania and the Speakership wars by a comprehensive approach to government reform and not merely cosmetic tinkering. -- Face the critical questions of what the quality of life in California should be and who should pay for it -- and stop ducking complex issues like health care, the environment, toxics, transportation, growth controls and regional government. How realistic are these resolutions? That\u0027s not easy to predict. Because what happens in Sacramento in 1989 will depend primarily on Gov. George Deukmejian, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and the onslaught of reapportionment. Deukmejian\u0027s decision whether or not to seek reelection will influence policy direction. Will he be persuaded to run by advisers who argue he has the best chance to keep the governor\u0027s chair Republican and thus prevent a Democratic gerrymander in the 1991 reapportionment? Or, looking toward retirement, will he opt to abandon his stubborn naysaying and attempt to build a legacy? Early signals are mixed. After mellowing on Gann limit revisions, he\u0027s again mulling wholesale budget chopping. The pledge that Speaker Brown recently made to ease up on politicking and concentrate on policy-making could also help chart a positive course for state government. Again, signals are mixed -- in view of the partisan sniping at Deukmejian\u0027s nominee for state treasurer by Brown\u0027s lieutenants. The Speaker\u0027s definition of \"doing policy\" is crucial. Policy-making is not selectively taking over legislators\u0027 bills and ramming them through the Assembly. A \"boutique\" approach to problem-solving is not leadership. A leader allows lawmakers to nurture their own programs, and then protects their bills through the entire Legislature and the governor\u0027s office, too. He stands up to special interests who fund legislative campaigns and then stymie legislative action. (In 1989, the real test will be if Brown opposes the state\u0027s trial lawyers, key political supporters, for enactment of comprehensive insurance reform.) But the strongest influence may be reapportionment. To make policy, legislators have to get elected, and governors need legislative majorities of their own party. Will Assembly Republicans, led by their confrontational leader, Ross Johnson of La Habra, frustrate policy through partisan, obstructionist games designed to wound the Democratic majority before reapportionment? Will dissident legislative Democrats quiet down in exchange for a \"kinder, gentler\" redistricting? Will incumbents and leaders of both parties opt to play it safe -- and not risk any new policy initiatives before reapportionment can assure their continued political survival? Who can predict whether 1989 will bring an end to Sacramento\u0027s political gridlock? The denizens of the state Capitol might prefer to hibernate until reapportionment season. But perhaps, as Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sepulveda speculated, \"If more solutions don\u0027t start coming out of this place, then no one will be around for reapportionment.\" If this prediction doesn\u0027t stir some resolve in Sacramento, nothing will.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition ITALY DEBATES A CAPITAL IDEA -- DOWN WITH ROME! Was the decision to make Rome the capital of Italy, taken in the last century, a mistake even bigger than the Colosseum itself? Yes, says Luigi Firpo, a history professor at Turin University and one of the luminaries among Italian intelligentsia. His opinion has probably been held by millions of other Italians since Rome actually became the Italian capital in 1870. It is an opinion likely to gain adherents in the next century. Many Romans, or those who call themselves Romans, agree that the Eternal City seems each day less likely to hold on to that defiant label much longer. For them, Rome entered an alarming new chapter around AD 1950, the year when everyone who could switched from bicycles to cars, and folks flocked in from the hills to join the Roman circus. Firpo, who now also sits in Parliament, has said that the degradation of Rome is total. The Romans are vulgar, arrogant and ignorant, he claims, and the city \"does not deserve to be the capital.\" For him, Rome is \"the only Levantine city without a European quarter.\" His remarks, uttered first in Parliament then repeated and expanded in interviews, brought a denial from his political party that he was speaking for them, and then angry words from the city\u0027s political bosses. Some of their responses were impoverished, falling back on the line that Rome was the natural capital because it once had been the capital of the Western World. This, Firpo said, was \"imperial rhetoric.\" Harking back to the empire was also one of Benito Mussolini\u0027s gambits, when the Italian dictator was playing from his balcony to cheering Roman crowds. Mussolini spoke of his Rome as being the city\u0027s third incarnation. First, the Rome of the Caesars, then the Rome of the Popes and finally the Rome of his glorious new Fascist regime. Prince Metternich, the 19th-Century Austrian statesman, dismissed the Italy of his time as being \"more a geographical expression than a country.\" A little later, Firpo\u0027s native Piedmont, the northwestern Italian region that borders Switzerland and France, produced a handful of noblemen who thought that Italy should become a unified nation for the first time since the fall of the Roman Empire. In 1861 the Piedmontese Parliament declared that one day Rome would be the new Italian capital. The rest of the country was then under foreign domination; Rome and other parts of Italy were ruled by the Pope. When the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in Turin, one unification supporter, the Marquis Massimo D\u0027Azeglio, said, \"We\u0027ve created an Italy -- now we must create the Italians.\" A strong argument could be made that his second goal is still a long way off. To relieve the Pope of his temporal powers, the Piedmontese entered Rome on Sept. 20, 1870, set up their king in what until the day before had been the Pope\u0027s residence and found themselves in possession of a city of fewer than 200,000 people, living in a poverty unknown elsewhere on the Italian peninsula. Today Rome\u0027s official population is 3 million, but each day it continues to attract migrants from hill towns and farms, drawn like moths to the bright lights. They soon find themselves living in shantytowns on the outskirts, without electricity or even plumbing. The arches of Roman aqueducts, built 2,000 years ago to supply water for Nero\u0027s baths, are now bricked up by migrants and serve as dwellings. A cover story on a feisty Italian weekly, Espresso, some time ago was titled, \"When the Capital Is Corrupt -- the Nation Is Infected.\" That was, and probably is, the attitude of Milan or any other modern metropolitan area in northern Italy toward the nation\u0027s capital. Each year the northern regions see their tax payments shipped to Rome for distribution in favor of southern Italy, an area just as rich in natural resources as the north and with double the unemployment. Alberto Moravia, the dean of Italian novelists, now a spry 83, is a Rome native. He was one of the first to jump on Firpo for his remarks, reminding him that when the Piedmontese entered Rome, they demolished many splendid buildings and private gardens to make Rome \"more modern.\" A few days later, Moravia recalled that he himself had written against Rome a few years back and offered proof that Firpo was not all that original in his thoughts. Moravia had said: \"Rome is not worthy of the name of being a European capital, like Paris or London. It is not a model for the nation to follow, but a sterile bureaucratic sponge that absorbs everything and gives nothing. Though the center of the church, it is the world\u0027s least spiritual city. Religion is present more with its bureaucracy than with its sentiment . . . . There is no circulation of ideas and persons in Rome, meaning there is no society of either.\" When Firpo was asked where he would prefer to have the Italian capital, he said, \"Somewhere near Chiusi, but in open country.\" Both he and Moravia agree that Chiusi -- an old Etruscan town midway between Rome and Florence -- is only their utopian dream. It is too late for an Italian Pretoria, Canberra, Brasilia or Washington, even though with their cars, Italy\u0027s central government and the entire elephantine bureaucracy are destroying the remains of both ancient and modern Rome with a wanton thoroughness that would give pause to Attila the Hun. If it had not been deemed necessary to dislodge the Pope from his temporal control over Rome, some of the Piedmontese were touting Naples as the nation\u0027s capital. It was, after all, the largest Italian city and still a major cultural influence in Europe. However, the Sicilians said they would never again accept Naples as a sovereign seat. What a pity. The Neapolitans have been living by their wits for centuries. They are clever about inventing jobs and pulling rabbits out of other peoples\u0027 hats. They are nimble, too, as people who choose to live under a smoldering volcano need to be. They have produced great painters, poets, composers, writers, architects -- while Rome has failed to produce even one. Had Naples become the Italian capital 100 years ago, it would have tilted the scale in favor of the Italian peninsula becoming a Mediterranean country, not what it is now -- an angry mix, half-European and half-Mediterranean. That is what Luigi Firpo\u0027s rage against Rome is all about. He spoke for millions of Italians who consider themselves European, and, incidentally, probably spoke also for foreign Europeans who must do business in Italy and who find themselves beating their heads against the city\u0027s bureaucratic rubber wall. The only way out of this Italian dilemma is for the north to secede from the union. Both sides would be winners.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition NICARAGUA STRUGGLES TO AID ITS CHILDREN Eight years of socially and economically devastating war with U.S.-backed Contra forces -- topped off 10 weeks ago by the most destructive hurricane in decades -- have sucked much of the substance but not the spirit from Nicaragua\u0027s 3.6 million people. A few years ago Nicaraguans talked enthusiastically of government campaigns to reduce infant mortality, eradicate malaria, distribute land to the landless and wipe out illiteracy. For a while great strides were made toward realizing those goals. But today, for the first time since the revolution that overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, children beg on the streets as government officials reluctantly slash health programs that once drew international praise. In an effort to help hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan children who have been displaced, wounded, orphaned or otherwise traumatized by the Contra war, the U.S. Congress appropriated $17.7 million. Two days after President Reagan signed the bill on Oct. 1, President Daniel Ortega said Nicaragua would not accept the money. To Nicaraguans, refusing the aid was a symbol of dignity and national pride. Tied to the legislation was a second bill that provided a similar amount in non-lethal aid to the Contras, the very forces whose attacks on civilian outposts were -- and still are -- responsible for the misery of many children. For Nicaragua to have accepted the aid, said Paul Oquist, an adviser to Ortega, would be comparable to the United States having accepted a donation of blood from Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor. \"If the U.S. wants to help children, lift the trade embargo and stop the war,\" he said. \"That would stop the production of orphans and allow more (Nicaraguan) resources to deal with the problem ourselves.\" Critics of the Sandinistas say the party\u0027s bungling management of the economy is the real reason for its desperate straights. They accuse the Sandinistas of torpedoing peace efforts with the Contras, suppressing the opposition press, squelching political dissent and endlessly confounding friend and foe alike with contradictory actions. Nevertheless, representatives of U.S. and foreign relief agencies based here and even mothers who have lost sons in the war say they supported Ortega\u0027s action. A summary of the immense effects of the war on children appears in a little-publicized report prepared last summer by a team of American health professionals sent to Nicaragua on behalf of the U.S. Agency for International Development to assess children\u0027s needs. Among their findings, gleaned from interviews with 40 humanitarian agencies working here and with the Nicaraguan government: -- About 500,000 of the nation\u0027s 1.8 million children under age 17 have been directly affected through destruction or disruption of schools and other services, displacement from homes, death of parents, injuries and psychological trauma. -- At least 455 children under 15 years have been killed and 691 are missing through the end of 1987. Another 1,542 under 15 have been wounded, with an additional 1,865 wounded among youngsters aged 15 through 20. About 1,200 have experienced serious physical handicaps such as amputations and 568 children have lost both parents, while 138 lost mothers and 9,371 lost fathers. -- As many as 50,000 children have suffered psychological trauma after seeing their villages shot up, parents or neighbors killed and having been forced to resettle in strange areas. Despite the cease-fire treaty of last spring, attacks on farm cooperatives and killing and wounding of children continue. In October, in the province of Jinotega, a well-marked Red Cross ambulance was shot up by Contras and one passenger was wounded. The Contras also attacked a civilian truck, killing nine civilians, three of them women. Two children injured in the attack later died. Four civilians were killed in an attack in another province that occurred only hours before Hurricane Joan struck on Oct. 22. Two American physicians, Tim Takaro and Susan Cookson, who have worked for two years in the Jinotega war zone, said $300,000 of the U.S. aid had been slated for treating intestinal parasites in 30,000 children in their region. But conditions imposed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which administers such aid funding, would have undermined the existing health system in Nicaragua, they said. AID requires that any private agency receiving federal funds have no connection with the Nicaraguan Health Ministry. Yet Takaro, Cookson and other U.S. health workers here agree that all private agencies working in health cooperate with the government system because that is the most efficient and economical way to get services to the people. One of the Health Ministry\u0027s goals since the 1979 revolution has been to expand health centers in rural areas. The policy saved many lives during the Contra conflict. Last summer\u0027s report by the American team on the needs of children noted with some surprise that the primary medical and social needs of most war-injured and orphaned children had already been cared for within government facilities. Most who required specialized care not available in Nicaragua were sent to Eastern Bloc countries, it said. Several Health Ministry doctors said there has been great difficulty arranging for specialized care in the United States. The priority need now, the report said, is for continuing rehabilitation within the children\u0027s own homes. All U.S. federal aid to Nicaragua was suspended in 1981. Some of the slack has been taken up by U.S. allies, including Canada, Sweden, Holland, Italy, France, Spain and other European countries who have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in medical supplies and assistance. Health Ministry officials said the severe strains on the economy have forced them to charge for certain health services that were previously free. Health workers have also been victims of Contra attacks. So far this year, according to Takaro and Cookson, two volunteer Nicaraguan health workers (brigadistas) have been killed in Jinotega province alone, eight have been kidnaped and three are missing. Because brigadistas live in communities where there is usually no doctor or nurse, their services are highly valued. \"They are hard to replace when killed because others become too frightened to volunteer,\" Cookson said. \"Eight health centers have been attacked by Contras in Jinotega this year. Some were destroyed and the medicine supplies were always destroyed.\" Hurricane Joan added to the general misery because of the destruction of crops, homes, roads, bridges and service centers totaling $828 million, according to the Social Welfare Ministry. Officials predict severe food shortages beginning in the spring as a result of ruined bean and corn crops. The ministry has called for $16.1 million in aid to clothe and feed for six months the 118,000 children whose lives were disrupted by the hurricane.",

The tiny country is surrounded by vicious enemies, who not only hate the Jewish state (as well as other non-Arab entities in the area: the Kurds, the Copts, the Armenians, etc.) but also each other. Who has Israel to talk to? The cowardly Jordanian monarch? Egypt, a country rocked by pro-Khomeini unrest, whose population has never accepted peace with Israel, and whose armed forces are being mindlessly and continuously strengthened by Western states? Iraq, Syria, Lybia -- all of whom control the Palestine Liberation Organization? Why is it that The Times does not urge totalitarian Arab states and terrorist organizations to put down their weapons, and stop all provocations? And what of \"an international peace meeting?\" Who will decide the future of Israel, who will guarantee its existence? The Soviet Union, an archaic colonial empire, whose unity is cemented by tanks and the blood of martyred White Russians, Ukrainians, Afghans, and the Balts? The United States, whose loyalty to its allies can be eloquently witnessed to by the late Shah of Iran, the betrayed anti-Castro Cubans of the Bay of Pigs, the Contras, the South Vietnamese? Or maybe pro-Arab France and Greece will guarantee Israel\u0027s right to exist? Israel has no choice but to forge a strong coalition, maintain a unity government, strengthen itself, and realize that in this world nobody can guarantee anything. The best Israel will get, if it depends on such generous advice, as The Times has given it, is a motion picture about its destruction. We will all cry and wonder why the second Holocaust was allowed. If the Israeli government decides to build Jewish settlements in the historic Jewish land, then it must do so -- without waiting for advice from a slanted and biased American media, whose news reporters eagerly write \"Israeli-occupied West Bank,\" but never write \"Soviet-occupied Estonia,\" or \"provocative Arab plans for the destruction of Israel.\" PAUL STONEHILL Los Angeles",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition FIXING THE WRONG THING When the two national political parties begin working together to make things \"better,\" better beware. During the last campaign, Democrats and Republicans formed a commission to grab sponsorship of the last presidential debate away from the League of Women Voters. The result was that the two presidential campaigns were able to dictate ground rules that resulted not in a real debate but in an excessively restricted and programmed question-answer session. Now the parties have joined in a new bipartisan commission to do something about the national political conventions. The commission has been directed to propose ways of streamlining the conventions so that they are more appealing to Americans on television. This is in obvious response to the poor ratings that the conventions drew last summer and to network television\u0027s reluctance to carry the entire proceedings. Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the retiring Republican national chairman, said that there had been criticism from the media that the conventions \"have become nothing more than staged activities in which nominees give canned speeches.\" The problem is that this dog is barking up the wrong tree. What needs fixing is the pre-convention nominating process that goes on forever and produces winners long before the delegates gather. The prospective nominees thus have control of the convention program and arrange things so that there is a minimum of uncertainty and controversy. This year even the names of the vice presidential running mates were known in advance, so the conventions were robbed of any remaining tidbit of suspense. What the national parties must do is shorten the primary campaign and start it someplace other than Iowa or New Hampshire. They need to be willing to have actual issues debated on the convention floor. They need some spontaneity and real action -- perhaps even a multiple roll-call contest for the nomination. They do not need more programming, but less. Fix the primary process, and the convention problem will fix itself.",

More troubling, perhaps because more human, is a language virus, transmitted orally or on paper, that spreads and replicates until meaning itself is destroyed. The term sea-change, for example, surges through the media these days, usually suggesting something mammoth -- as a sea-change in Soviet politics or a sea-change in Sean Penn\u0027s police relations. The original usage was Shakespeare\u0027s, and the bard was literally suggesting what the sea could do to a human body. Only in 1988 did a tidal wave of sea-changes cover the land as well. Arguably is, arguably, the latest fad in suggesting uncertainty. The trouble is the way it appears everywhere and may confuse -- should be argued or may be argued -- even as it hedges. A learned editor in this neighborhood has decided to forbid writers from having anyone shoot himself or herself or themselves in the foot to describe inadvertent behavior. If all the recently shot feet stood end-to-end, they would stretch the length of the John Muir Trail. Unique is a word that isn\u0027t. This virus has so infected the language that particular or unusual or other simple, less assertive terms for rarity have all but disappeared in favor of a one and only connotation -- usually false, often in an advertisement. Cliches are the most common strain of language virus. Gobbledygook is the mutation most often affecting bureaucrats and politicians who would rather be obscure than be right. The National Council of Teachers of English awarded Public Doublespeak citations for 1988 to the agricultural spokesperson who called pigs and cows \"grain-consuming animal units,\" and to the safety expert who described an aircraft crash as \"uncontrolled contact with the ground.\" At this point in time, our lingering wheeze from Watergate days, there is no vaccine for verbal virus. Susceptible word-consuming human units are advised to avoid talk shows and look out for 30-second spots.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition LITTLE CHOCOLATE DOUGHNUTS TELL THE TALE OF THE U.S. TRADE CRISIS We hear a lot of talk that if the United States were allowed to compete on an equal footing with foreign manufacturers, our product quality and marketing skills would once again make us No. 1 in the world. Well, I offer for consideration the following true story (I\u0027ve protected the names of the manufacturers involved, but any connoisseur of little chocolate doughnuts will recognize their identities). Brand X is recognized as the Cadillac of little chocolate doughnuts -- light, fresh, with a chocolatey coating that is thick. Sweet. Oh-so-yummy. Most people\u0027s first choice. But we don\u0027t always have a choice. The micro-mini-market near me (selling \"booze \u0027n\u0027 munchies,\" according to its sign) carried only Brand Y -- heavy, dry little chocolate doughnuts with a dark, oil-slick coating that leaves you looking as if you\u0027ve just been fingerprinted. Still, when you wake up at the crack of noon needing little chocolate doughnuts to get your day started, you take what you can get. (Anyone who asks why I don\u0027t just go to the supermarket once a week and buy the ValuePak of Brand X little chocolate doughnuts should stop reading. You\u0027ve no understanding of the American consumer and will miss the point of the story.) One morning, overcome by the urge for little chocolate doughnuts, I walked into the booze \u0027n\u0027 munchies store for a dose of Brand Y\u0027s LCDs. With a grimace, I bit into one. WHAM! Light, fresh! Oh-so-yummy! I looked at the package: no \"New and Improved!\" No \"Now with even MORE Chocolatey Goodness!\" But yes -- they were good! Almost as good (dare I think it?) as Brand X! I could purchase Brand Y little chocolate doughnuts proudly, no longer afraid that others were looking upon me with scorn (\"Mommy! He\u0027s buying Brand Y!\" \"Don\u0027t point, Junior. Some people aren\u0027t as fortunate as we are. . . .\"). It was a wonderful day! A month later the booze \u0027n\u0027 munchies store was sold. The new owner was behind the counter one morning as I bought my pack of Brand Y little chocolate doughnuts. \"Going to start getting Brand X,\" he said. \"Great, although these have gotten a lot better.\" He shrugged. \"Well, now you\u0027ll have your choice.\" You\u0027ll have your choice! Boy, that\u0027s the American way. Sure enough, a few days later, there they were, side-by-side: Brand X and Brand Y. What a great moment it was, being able to buy Brand X little chocolate doughnuts, the BEST little chocolate doughnuts. Only. . . . Something strange hit me midway through my first pack of Brand X little chocolate doughnuts in months -- I missed Brand Y. Had I grown accustomed to Brand Y\u0027s lower quality? Was Brand X too rich for my blood? The next day I held a taste test, alternating a little chocolate doughnut from Brand X with one from Brand Y. After 12 little chocolate doughnuts, I arrived at the startling conclusion: Brand Y had surpassed Brand X in chocolatey yumminess. I switched back to Brand Y. And I was happy. For about two weeks. One morning I stumbled into the B \u0027n\u0027 M store for breakfast. No Brand Y little chocolate doughnuts. They weren\u0027t just out -- the entire rack was gone. Little chocolate doughnuts, cupcakes, wholesome snack pies -- everything. \"The Brand Y people refused to be in the same store with Brand X,\" explained the owner. \"Said if I kept selling Brand X, they\u0027d pull out.\" \"But I like their little chocolate doughnuts better than Brand X\u0027s,\" I protested. He shrugged. \"Love to sell both, but Brand X has the better name.\" So I bought Brand X. Don\u0027t get me wrong -- they were good. But they weren\u0027t Brand Y. Next morning, Brand X was sold out. \"Distributor comes Thursdays,\" said the owner. This was Saturday. After a little-chocolate-doughnutless weekend, I went into the store Monday. There, where once the Brand Y rack had stood, was a rack of Brand Z products -- cupcakes, wholesome snack pies and . . . little chocolate doughnuts. I bought a pack. Eeyew! Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts are not as bad as the old Brand Y little chocolate doughnuts were, but Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts, as I\u0027m sure you experts will agree, simply have no taste. They\u0027re only good for the desperate times when Brand X is sold out. Which is usually. The booze \u0027n\u0027 munchies store gets its shipment of Brand X little chocolate doughnuts every Thursday.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition WHERE WAS U.S. IN NICARAGUA\u0027S HOUR OF NEED?; DENIAL OF HUMANITARIAN AID CLASHES WITH OPEN HEARTS TOWARD ARMENIA The sight of rescue teams from around the world ignoring politics and rushing help to victims of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia has been one of the bright spots of a holiday season dimmed by disaster. We in the United States can take pride in our contribution. The instinctive response to the plight of the Armenians sent forth a signal that the people of the world realize that we live in a global village. Leaders of the Soviet Union abandoned their policy of secrecy and isolation while long-time adversaries of the Soviet Union put aside past animosities. The lesson of Armenia is that politics is not an issue when human beings have suffered terrible loss. A notable example came from an Israeli rescue team, some of whom had emigrated from the Soviet Union with no thought of returning. Although the two nations have not had diplomatic relations for more than 20 years, this did not hinder the mission in Spitak and Leninakan. The team stayed for more than two weeks, triumphing when a 15-year-old boy was pulled alive from the debris eight days after the earthquake. Unfortunately, there are children much closer to us geographically than those in Armenia who are homeless and hungry and whose parents have lost their lives or livelihoods in a natural disaster. These children and their families have not received aid through the government of the United States. They are the victims of Hurricane Joan in Nicaragua. While the disaster in Armenia was of much greater dimension, Hurricane Joan had a devastating effect on Nicaragua. It left 250,000 persons homeless. Almost 3 million people lost crops or otherwise suffered economic loss. Hospitals and schools were damaged or destroyed. A team of United Nations economists has estimated the loss at $840 million. Despite appeals from members of Congress and private groups such as Oxfam and the American Friends Service Committee, the United States has refused assistance to Nicaragua. Jamaica and Costa Rica, hit by the same storm, received help from this country. There have been no explanations as to why Nicaragua was counted out. Politics is the only apparent cause. Historically, U.S. policy has been to provide disaster relief as a purely humanitarian gesture, independent of politics. This dates back to a successful program led by Herbert Hoover to restore Europe after World War I and has continued through the Marshall Plan until today. In 1988 such aid went to victims of floods in Bangladesh and the Sudan, monsoons in India and Nepal, Typhoon Ruby in the Philippines. These actions flow from the Foreign Assistance Act, which authorizes the President \"to furnish assistance to any foreign country, international organization, or private voluntary organization, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for international disaster relief and rehabilitation.\" The responsibility is clearly the President\u0027s. President Reagan, in a recent interview with David Brinkley, called Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega a \"shameless dictator\" who \"doesn\u0027t stand in the same box with (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev.\" Has the politics of aid reached the point of distinguishing between avowed communists when giving or withholding humanitarian aid? Should we allow the behavior of the Sandinistas to keep us from responding to people stricken by disaster? While we are not in open conflict with either the Soviet Union or Nicaragua, the recent history of national enmity makes it imperative to maintain the principle of nonpolitical humanitarian aid to innocent civilians. To undermine this principle erodes the internationally accepted Geneva conventions that have enabled the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and other agencies to bring medicine and food to noncombatants in times of war. The only country in the world that could pose a serious, immediate threat to the United States is the Soviet Union. Yet, we have responded generously to innocent civilians in that country in their hour of need. Under Anastasio Somoza, whose regime was more brutal and repressive, the United States provided relief to Nicaraguan earthquake victims. Reporters have been told that the Nicaraguan government would not accept assistance if it were offered. The National Assembly did reject a portion of the Contra aid package intended for all children who had been injured by the civil strife. In mid-November Ortega clarified that the ban was limited to the Contra package. Shortly thereafter, the Nicaraguan charge d\u0027affaires in Washington said publicly that U. S. aid would be accepted through international organizations. The new openness of the Soviet government, as it welcomes outside help and becomes more a part of the world community, is a sign to the incoming Administration to reverse a foreign policy that has too often put ideology above basic human needs, above values that transcend government or party. It is time to reaffirm the American tradition of generous response to need simply because the need exists. Providing humanitarian aid promotes the national interests of the United States. We must recognize, however, that such aid makes its greatest contribution to our credibility and our reputation in the world when it is delivered in a nonpolitical manner.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition BY GOING FOR BROKE, U.S. FOULS FARM TALKS You don\u0027t need a Ph.D in economics to understand the European Community\u0027s common agricultural policy. It sets artificially high farm prices that create vast food surpluses. In November, for example, the world price for corn averaged $97 a metric ton. Meanwhile, the policy promised European farmers a minimum price of $212, a 119% premium. Naturally, European farmers produce as much as they can. Any surpluses are then dumped onto the world market with huge subsidies. It\u0027s clear who\u0027s hurt. First come Europe\u0027s consumers and taxpayers. Their food costs are too high, and 60% to 80% of the European Community\u0027s budget goes to the policy. Next come more efficient farmers -- in the United States, Australia, Canada, Argentina and other nations -- who lose export sales to the Europeans. Considering all these victims, there ought to be strong pressure on the European Community to change the policy. Think again. An intense U.S. campaign against the policy has had almost no success. It\u0027s a telling failure of economic diplomacy. Increasingly, the United States can advance its economic interests abroad only with the help of other nations. We\u0027re no longer so powerful that we can control the outcome of global negotiations. But we\u0027re clumsy at creating the international coalitions necessary to prevail. The farm negotiations (under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT) are a case in point. When the talks recently broke down in Montreal, the Americans -- not the Europeans -- were mainly blamed. Make no mistake: The talks are critical for U.S. agriculture. They may represent the best chance for America to cut its own costly farm subsidies. American harvests are steadily rising; last summer\u0027s drought only interrupted a long-term trend. Without expanding exports, U.S. farmers face rising surpluses and falling prices. The pressures for continued subsidies would be enormous. Other food exporters confront the same dilemma. Finally, greater agricultural exports would help some developing countries escape the debt crisis. But somehow U.S. trade negotiators have turned a strong moral position into political weakness. It\u0027s not that other food exporters like the agricultural policy. They don\u0027t. Most of the European Community\u0027s minimum prices (like that of corn) are set well above market levels. In November, the minimum price for a metric ton of soybeans was $577, more than double the world price of $267. Consumers pay these high prices. The Community maintains them by buying any surpluses at the minimums. Cheaper imports are generally kept out with variable levies that raise import prices slightly above the minimums. The result is that farmers elsewhere lose exports to Europe and must compete with European food surpluses -- sold at subsidized prices -- in third countries. The policy\u0027s protection has kept high-cost farmers in business. Efficient farmers are spurred to increase output by overusing fertilizers and pesticides. Food production has soared. The European Community once imported wheat; it became an exporter in the early 1970s. Since 1980, output of oil seeds (such as soybeans) has more than quadrupled. By all logic, the Australians, Canadians and others ought to be loudly echoing U.S. demands that the Europeans alter the policy. But the United States has alienated its natural allies by insisting that all countries commit themselves -- in advance of detailed negotiations -- to the eventual elimination of most farm subsidies. For the Europeans, this would mean signing an immediate death warrant for the policy. That\u0027s political suicide. It was this humiliating demand that caused the breakdown at Montreal. Other governments regard the U.S. position as wildly unreasonable. It\u0027s also unnecessary. The issue is not (as the U.S. position implies) all or nothing. Suppose the policy\u0027s excessive prices are cut 60% to 80% over a decade. That would be an immense achievement. But the talks are now stalemated over a non-negotiable principle. The Europeans have scored a public-relations coup and don\u0027t have to say how they\u0027d change the policy to reduce its adverse consequences. The agricultural policy is not, of course, the only example of farm folly. In addition to direct subsidies, the United States maintains import quotas on sugar and dairy products. Japan and Korea restrict rice imports. Any trade agreement would have to attack all these distortions. The political obstacles are similar everywhere. Farmers have grown dependent on protection, and governments often depend on the votes of farmers. But opening up world agriculture is not a utopian dream. It has a big constituency -- food exporters and, less obviously, taxpayers and consumers. The trouble is that the United States has yet to mobilize this constituency. Any hard negotiation is full of drama and deadlocks. The GATT talks are scheduled to continue until 1990. They could yet succeed. But for that to happen, the United States will have to pursue its goals more adeptly. That\u0027s the real lesson here. Being right is not enough if, in the process, everyone else is offended by American self-righteousness.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition OUR FORCES ARE AT THE READY, BUT NOT FOR CUTBACKS As concerns about the American economy grow, the debate over defense spending continues at a feverish pace. An entire spectrum of ideas has been placed before the public, with critics or \"defense experts\" having their own agenda on how to cut defense in an effort to reduce the nation\u0027s budgetary deficit. The discussions of cuts that indiscriminately have an impact on defense capabilities and current military readiness are both disconcerting and frustrating. The last eight years have seen some unmistakable gains in our military readiness and capability. U.S. naval forces (in fact, all U.S. military forces) have never been stronger or more ready. America\u0027s position in the world has also never been so strong. Our friends, who have never feared our leadership and have only wanted to count on our strength, can do just that. And potential adversaries now have to recalculate their ambitions because of our strength. Still, we see a move by various people who seem hellbent on throwing those gains away. Eight years ago, our political leaders -- with the support of the American public -- committed themselves to an investment. The investment was a large one, but was necessary to recover from the neglect of the 1970s when the military suffered from low states of readiness. Some ships couldn\u0027t sail because of material problems and personnel shortages; aircraft readiness was low because of lack of spare parts and trained maintenance personnel; morale problems abounded. This tremendous investment provided the nation with an extremely capable fleet and a professional personnel force that has never been more dedicated, spirited or well-trained. Simply stated, never has the Navy been more ready to respond to a wide range of contingencies and threats. The question is, does the nation have the resolve to preserve its investment or is it willing to return to the dark days of just a few years ago? To allow the latter to happen and fail to protect the investment would be the biggest case of fraud, waste and abuse this country has ever seen. History has repeatedly shown us the consequences of complacency. The critics would like to make us believe that we can\u0027t afford a strong military. They argue that the defense buildup has caused the budget deficit. Today, however, defense spending is less than 6% of our gross national product. During the years of the so-called Reagan buildup, it was never more than 6.3% -- and it has declined steadily in the last four years. But 20 years ago, that figure was 9% -- and we had a balanced federal budget. If one looks at a graph of defense and non-defense spending since 1969 (the last year of a balanced budget), we see that the curve for defense is relatively flat but that the curve for non-defense spending keeps turning upward at an alarming rate. And the key point is that the curve almost exactly matches the slope of our federal budget deficit. It is frustrating for those in senior military positions -- those who are directly responsible for providing for our nation\u0027s security and who had to deal firsthand with our diminished capability in the last decade -- to see the apparent complacency, the almost perverted idealism, the unscrupulous politicking and the inability to see reason and logic in the one element of our great democracy in which the national interest should be above parochial interest. It is frustrating to deal with those who argue that because we have built something that works, we can afford to neglect it for a while. It is frustrating to argue with those who can\u0027t stand success, who can\u0027t seem to be comfortable with strength and who would apparently prefer being lovable losers. Why are we turning our backs on defense? People listen to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, probably the greatest PR man in this century, and they think, in the immortal words of Neville Chamberlain, that we will have \"peace for our time.\" Unfortunately, it\u0027s not true; or at least, not yet. It has long been a military axiom that you must not get tangled up trying to unravel your opponent\u0027s intentions. Instead, you must keep your eyes on capabilities. To that end, many intelligent people seem to overlook the fact that Soviet military capabilities continue to grow while their intentions are being slickly packaged to look like democracy in action. Certainly something is happening in the Soviet Union today. But what it is, what it means and how long it will last are still uncertainties. The Soviets have not dismantled a single military system that they were not bound to do under constraints of treaty. Except in Afghanistan, they have not withdrawn from a single maritime or military position. It\u0027s still a very dangerous world and the threat still threatens. We can watch and hope. But let\u0027s keep our heads on straight.",

It even wins for food, some of which is cooked to order on board. If you like your eggs poached, they\u0027ll be poached. Best Business-Class Service: British Airways. The airline has come a long way from the old business class of coach seats and a few free drinks. Its new Club Class is well recommended. Honorable mention to Virgin Atlantic. The airline\u0027s \"upper-class\" service is a well-kept secret. It\u0027s excellent, and equals, if not surpasses, other airlines\u0027 first-class sections in terms of passenger space and other goodies, like a free one-way coach ticket for taking just one trip. Best Coach Service: Lufthansa. Efficient, courteous and even the meals are thoughtful, with things like fresh fruit. Best First-Class Seats: If you want to know the reason why Royal Jordanian Airlines has spent upwards of $10,000 per first-class airline seat, just sit down. These hydraulic electric marvels are truly the closest things to real beds an airline can provide. Rivals to First Class Best Business-Class Seats: a tie, between Cathay Pacific Airlines and British Airways. Both airlines radically restructured their business class in 1988, and a major part of that included removing and redesigning business-class seats, head rests, leg rests and added leg room. And both airlines did almost too good a job in business class. Each is now laboring to make its first class even better, because in many cases the improved business class now rivals first class on some other airlines. Best Coach Seats: No award. In this category, things have actually gotten worse, not better. Cleanest Planes: Japan Airlines. Its flight attendants come as close to providing perfect service as possible. Can you name another airline where the flight attendants rush into the lavatories after each passenger has left to clean them? Best Domestic Airline: American Airlines. It still has a deserved reputation for consistency of service and one of the best route structures in the United States. It is also an airline that is rapidly expanding to Europe through new U.S. gateways like Raleigh-Durham, N.C. Western Winner Best Regional Airline: Alaska Airlines. The airline, based in Seattle, offers great in-flight food, good on-time performance, clean airplanes and some of the nicest, most helpful flight attendants I\u0027ve ever met. In case you haven\u0027t flown the airline, Alaska flies to 32 cities in the United States and Mexico. Best International Airline: a three-way tie among Singapore Airlines, Thai International and SAS. Best Domestic Airport: a three-way tie. If you define a great airport as (1) convenient, (2) efficient and (3) passenger-friendly, then kudos must go to the airports in Oakland, Kansas City and Tampa. They are distinctly uncrowded, well designed and pleasant. Best International Airport: Schiphol, in Amsterdam. It defines the word efficiency. And, if you like duty-free shopping, this is your place. Honorable mention: Changi Airport in Singapore. The Humanitarian Travel Award: Doubletree Hotels. Again this year, the hotel chain will provide free short-term lodging for those in need during this holiday season. The chain\u0027s Room at the Inn program is offered to individuals and families visiting loved ones in out-of-town hospitals, and runs each year from Thanksgiving through New Year\u0027s Eve. Honorable mention to Clark Howard, a retired travel agency owner. Earlier this year, Eastern Airlines had a special promotion for its 60th birthday. The offer: People who flew the airline 60 times in 60 days would get 60 free tickets. Eastern never thought anyone would take them up on the offer. But Howard did -- and won, then gave the tickets to several charities in Georgia so that local needy children could take their first plane ride as well as enjoy a California vacation. Vacation Tips The Safe Travel Award: Westin Maui. You can thank the hotel, or perhaps its attorneys, for this, but thanks are due to the hotel for providing truly useful information about the sun and surf. In a pamphlet distributed to its arriving guests, the hotel gives specific tanning advice: \"Spend a short time in the sun during your first day or two and gradually build up during your stay.\" Some swimming advice: \"Enter the ocean gradually and carefully. Breakers come in \u0027sets\u0027 with spells of calm in between.\" Plus: \"Never turn your back to the ocean.\" If this seems like basic common sense, it is. But remember, most visitors to Maui don\u0027t live near the water, nor do they enjoy year-round sunshine. The Thoughtful Hotel Award: a tie, between the Hyatt Key West Hotel and Stouffer Hotels and Resorts. Earlier this year, when the Key West International Airport needed a face lift, but there was no county budget for the project, the Hyatt Key West hotel staff donated their time and repainted the terminal. Stouffer wins for abandoning a long-standing rip-off in the hotel business. The chain correctly identified a major traveler complaint, and dropped surcharges on credit-card phone calls, collect calls and calls to toll-free 800 numbers. Three cheers to Stouffer; it\u0027s about time. Honorable mention to Hyatt Hotels, which has decided against using the more expensive alternative operator service (AOS) to supply its long-distance service. The Thoughtful Airline Award: UTA French Airlines. In order to welcome Americans to France, folks who travel on a UTA Holidays trip will receive a \"telecard\" good for a free four-minute call to the United States. The Freedom of Travel Award: to Japan. An agreement was just reached between the United States and Japan exempting most Americans from needing a visa to visit the country. Now, if we could only afford the visit! And Just for Fun There are also some unusual award winners: The 1988 Best Travel Lawsuit Award: to the case of the sunburned buns. A court in Madison, Wis., heard the story of the woman who stayed in the artificial sun a little too long. The woman sued a local tanning salon, claiming she suffered second-degree burns that ruined her vacation in Jamaica by making it impossible to bask on the beach. She won. And, finally, the 1988 Best Retort to a Lost Travel Lawsuit Award: to Robert Hazard, president and chief executive officer of Quality International. The company was sued by McDonald\u0027s after it announced its intention to use the name \"McSleep\" for a chain of budget hotels. After McDonald\u0027s won the suit, Hazard announced the new chain would be called \"Jack in the Sack.\" Actually, the new hotels will be called Sleep Inns. Merry Christmas.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition ONE ENCHANTED DAY WHEN PETER RABBIT STIRRED The names Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail have never figured very large in my adult vocabulary. Not that they weren\u0027t there. They were just too deep in memory for easy retrieval. Your average semi-macho guys, or even us everyday garden variety couch potatoes, just don\u0027t tend to hang onto those memories we formed before being checked out on two-wheel bikes. Unless we\u0027ve had a refresher course. My wife and I recently had a refresher course. A few months ago, we were in the Lake District of Cumbria -- which is about hip high on the British Isles -- and having a pretty good time. There aren\u0027t a whole lot of places on this earth as pretty or as peaceful. Many Lakes We were told there are 23 lakes. Someone else said there are 19, so I suspect the total number sort of depends on whether or not it rained recently. I do know that however many there are, they\u0027re in one of the most awe-inspiring settings. Mile after mile of rolling meadows, forests and mountains, their tops frequently lost in cloud. There are fields of wildflowers, waterfalls and about every green that nature\u0027s got. There are sheep -- armies of sheep, eating as fast as they can but never catching up with the growing landscape. And there\u0027s something else . . . a feeling that goes with the territory. Joyce and I were talking with Paul Carlin, a friend who\u0027d come to the Lake District from London to manage the Borrowdale Gates Hotel near Keswick. He grinned as we raved about the countryside, as proud as if he\u0027d created it himself. Visitors From All Over \"It\u0027s truly unique, you know, and I know what you mean about the feeling,\" Carlin said. \"People come to the Lake District from your Wisconsin and Minnesota, where lakes are common. \"Even from Colorado and British Columbia, whose mountains and lakes dwarf what we have here. And they\u0027re just as enchanted as everyone else. And I think I know the reason. It\u0027s not the lakes, you know.\" \"What is it?\" Joyce asked. \"Well,\" Carlin said, \"I\u0027m almost afraid to talk about it.\" He leaned forward and lowered his voice. \"It may be something left over from the Druids or Merlin\u0027s time, but I think it\u0027s magic. I really believe there is a kind of enchantment here.\" We\u0027d almost come to that conclusion on our own. You can\u0027t drive through the area without having that thought. We\u0027d recently visited Dove Cottage, where William Wordsworth lived with his family. Though the cottage looks as if it\u0027s 300 years old, it\u0027s really kind of commonplace. The most unusual thing about it is that the children\u0027s rooms are wallpapered with newspapers. (The guidebook said Wordsworth thought it would make the rooms warmer in the winter.) Setting Is Unusual But it\u0027s not the cottage, it\u0027s the setting that makes it unusual. When you see the view from the room where Wordsworth did his writing, you begin to understand. You see Lake Grasmere cupped in rolling green hills, as still and reflecting as a mirror. The morning we were there, a few clouds were all but settling on its surface; you could feel a bit of the magic. There was no way a man of Wordsworth\u0027s talents could have lived in the area without becoming what he was -- a poet laureate, the greatest poet on nature that England has produced. \"Wordsworth? Yes,\" Carlin said. \" \u0027Lucy,\u0027 \u0027The Solitary Reaper\u0027 and \u0027Daffodils\u0027 are very nice. And you\u0027ll never convince me that James Hilton didn\u0027t spend some time here before he wrote about Shangri-La in \u0027Lost Horizon,\u0027 but I was thinking more in terms of Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail.\" \"Who?\" I asked. \"Peter Rabbit!\" Joyce exclaimed. \"That\u0027s right! Beatrix Potter lived here in the Lake Country, didn\u0027t she?\" Almost Missed House \"That\u0027s what I meant by enchantment,\" Carlin said. \"Her house is just down the way. I\u0027ll jot down some directions for you.\" It wasn\u0027t \"just down the way\" at all. It was a couple of lakes and a few dozen turns down a long road, but the trip wasn\u0027t a chore, because the country itself was satisfying. We missed the house the first time and had to backtrack. We\u0027d have missed it again, except a small sign said, \"Hill Top House,\" which my wife recognized from the stories. At first there didn\u0027t seem to be any true personality about the place. Slowly the lady herself, Beatrix Potter, began to take form as our guide walked us through the garden. \"It\u0027s patterned after Mr. McGregor\u0027s garden,\" she said. \"Does that ring a bell?\" Suddenly Interested It meant something to most of the visitors, including Joyce, whose interest in the garden was suddenly aroused. \"Who\u0027s McGregor?\" I asked. \"Refresh my memory.\" No one answered. They were all listening as the guide led us into the house. She explained how Miss Potter had lived in an era that expected all proper young women to go from their father\u0027s house to their husband\u0027s. Beatrix, a very average-looking young lady who spent a good part of her growing-up years in the sparsely settled area, had been alone a lot. Having few callers and a great deal of time, she had taken to sketching and writing stories about the things she knew and loved, like the countryside and some of its inhabitants. One of them was a very young rabbit, whom she named Peter. It wasn\u0027t much of a story. It dealt with Peter leaving his siblings -- Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail, who were \"good little bunnies\" -- and going out and losing the new coat his mother had made him. He lost it when he was almost caught by Mr. McGregor, whose garden Peter had been told never to visit. Limited Edition In 1902, probably more on the strength of the sketches than the stories, a London publisher took a chance and brought out a limited edition of \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit.\" There were no limitations from then on. Beatrix Potter wrote and illustrated more than 25 children\u0027s books, which were published in dozens of languages, to the delight of millions of children. And then their children and their children\u0027s children. \"Did Beatrix Potter have children of her own?\" someone asked. \"She eventually married a man named William Heelis,\" the guide answered, \"but she was childless.\" A woman asked if Miss Potter had been able to enjoy any of her success, or whether fame had only come after her death. \"She was a very canny lady who enjoyed huge success and made a great deal of money.\" Purchased Land The tour group grew silent. \"In fact,\" said the guide, \"she loved the district so, that to have some control over what might happen to it, she began slowly buying up more and more property in the area to keep it from being destroyed by what the world calls \u0027progress.\u0027 \"In addition to her writing, she spent her time working to protect all of this part of Cumbria, to keep it pure and unspoiled for all time. Her efforts are largely responsible for the fact that this whole district is now under the protection of the National Trust. God willing, and thanks to Beatrix Potter, it may be protected forever.\" The tour ended and we left the house, a few feet behind a young family. As we entered the garden again, a bird flew out of the hedge just in front of us. The daughter of the family, a girl of perhaps 4 or 5, heard the rustling noise and turned quickly. Thought She Saw Him \"Oh, papa,\" she said excitedly. The mother and father stopped and turned. The little girl spoke excitedly to her parents in a language neither Joyce nor I could understand. Her father answered her and then smiled at us. \"She wants to know was that Peter Rabbit who just came out of the bushes. I told her I didn\u0027t know because I had not seen.\" The little girl thought for a few seconds and then, nodding her head firmly, spoke again. Her father translated. \"She says she thinks it was Peter Rabbit, that she thinks she caught a glimpse of him.\" The little girl ran around looking under rose bushes and behind hedges for another glimpse as we approached the gate cottage. Interesting Theory Almost as a conspirator, the father shared a final thought with his wife and with us. \"It probably was not really Peter Rabbit, you know. That rabbit would be 85 years old now.\" He winked. \"Probably one of his children or his grandchildren, huh?\" Carlin stopped by our dinner table in the hotel dining room that night and asked if we\u0027d made it to Hill Top House and what we thought of his theory. \"You didn\u0027t tell us what the lady had done for the district.\" \"Or,\" Joyce said, \"that it was Peter Rabbit that really started it all.\" \"And, I\u0027ll bet,\" Carlin said, \"that they told you Beatrix Potter never had any children, too.\" \"You mean she did?\" I asked. \"The way I see it, she had millions of children . . . generations of millions of children,\" he said. \"And didn\u0027t she leave them a lovely garden to play in?\"",

Thus, I get to see the Soviet Union as it really is. Most of your readers have no idea what the real Soviet Union is like. They spend two weeks in tourist cities and they become instant experts. Glasnost is something that has been developed to appease the Western world. In reality there has been very little change.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition INSIGHTFUL COMMENTARY; BLIND TWIN BROTHERS GIVE SIGHTLESS RADIO LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF ROSE PARADE While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio commentators will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses. John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for the third time from high in the press box. The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC, Pasadena City College\u0027s radio station, a program that will be carried all over the country via satellite. Sighted Listeners, Too Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC since 1980, the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience. After much preparation, including \"feeling tours\" of floats under construction, they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes they have felt. But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the Gassmans\u0027 spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well. \"We\u0027ve had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio,\" Shirk said. He called the twins \"extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses of humor.\u0027 Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade\u0027s \"informational\" station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and after the parade broadcast. As on the past two New Year\u0027s Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on Orange Grove and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes. Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, \"When our fingertips freeze, the Braille becomes fuzzy. That\u0027s like reading a printed page and the lights go out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they still froze. Now we\u0027re going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually, it\u0027s fun to figure out what to do.\" Transcribe Into Braille In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their observations while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information and details than they have ever needed. In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup. \"He tells us to speed up or slow down,\" John said. \"Anyone knows that when you\u0027re describing a float and a band goes by, there\u0027s something wrong.\" They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast, questioning and answering to \"keep it conversational.\" \"We want to be talking to people, not at them,\" John said. \"Talking at people is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like we\u0027re reading. \"If we use humor, it\u0027s not conscious, but if there\u0027s something funny and its in good taste, well. . . . \" Weekly Program They have had years of practice, anticipating each other\u0027s comments and keeping up a lively patter. Their weekly radio show, \"Same Time, Same Station,\" is on KPCC every Sunday from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of 13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, \"Suspense\" and \"Fibber McGee and Molly.\" Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows. Their collection is what John called \"medium-sized, but all high-quality\" recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually growing as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country. They are identical twins who live together in their own home in Whittier, where they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio Hondo College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts of a \"Top 40s\" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. They are not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead to jobs. Second Nature They said their parents, both of whom have died, \"purposely taught us that we were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature.\" They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. As with many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently blinded by excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep them alive. \"We\u0027ve never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it,\" Larry said. \"We just learned to adapt and make the best of it. We\u0027re not negative people anyway.\" They said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people all over the country, not all of them blind. \"No negative feedback, as far as we know,\" John said.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition 2 AGENCIES STRIVE TO TAKE OVER PEST ABATEMENT IN L.B. In what is developing into a territorial skirmish over mosquitoes, two government agencies are swatting at each other over which of them would do a better job of combating the city\u0027s mosquito population. The Southeast Mosquito Abatement District, which oversees mosquito control in the central and northeastern sections of the city, wants authority over mosquitoes in the rest of Long Beach -- now the province of the city Department of Health and Human Services. District officials contend the health department is too busy fighting other public health threats, such as rats, to pay sufficient heed to mosquitoes. Local health officials have, for their part, taken umbrage at the suggestion that mosquitoes are running wild in their part of the city. They retort that the abatement district is attempting to justify its mosquito grab with error-strewn allegations that the city\u0027s equipment, pesticides and vigilance are inferior. The district has long wanted to bring Long Beach under one anti-mosquito umbrella -- its own. Formed in 1952, the regional district assumed responsibility for what was then unincorporated county land in the Long Beach area. When the city annexed the land, the district retained mosquito jurisdiction, leaving Long Beach divided as far as mosquitoes were concerned. Other Communities Served What\u0027s more, the city of Signal Hill, surrounded by Long Beach, is in the district, as are the cities to the north of Long Beach. \"We do a very extensive and thorough job of mosquito control,\" Jack Hazelrigg, the district\u0027s assistant manager and entomologist, said. While the city \"does a good job,\" Hazelrigg added, \"we can do a better job.\" The district\u0027s sole purpose in life is to keep mosquitoes in check, Hazelrigg stressed. It does that in 32 cities in Los Angeles County, along with unincorporated parts of the county. Diana M. Bonta, recently appointed director of the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services, says she has no vested interest in guarding the city\u0027s mosquito turf. Nonetheless, she says she was disheartened at some of the district\u0027s contentions and feels compelled to correct them. She also points out that it would cost residents slightly more if they switched to the district, and she argues that a local, rather than a regional agency, is more likely to be responsive to residents\u0027 complaints. The arbiter of the matter, the City Council, has referred the district\u0027s annexation request to its Public Safety Committee, which is holding hearings on the issue. Undecided on Changes \"Personally, I haven\u0027t found the city to be wanting,\" Councilman Ray Grabinski, the committee\u0027s chairman, said. Grabinski, whose West Long Beach district falls under the city\u0027s jurisdiction, hastened to add that he had not decided whether any changes were in order. The move to bring all of Long Beach into the district was bolstered last summer when West Long Beach residents were tormented by swarms of midges, gnat-like, flying insects that do not bite, but do bother people. \"You didn\u0027t want to open your mouth to breathe,\" said Dan Cangro of the Wrigley Assn., a neighborhood group that complained to the council that the city\u0027s bug-control efforts were not all they might be. \"It\u0027s always been our contention that if we were under the mosquito (district) program, we wouldn\u0027t have these problems. . . . The city has been pretty good, but it\u0027s been on a case-by-case basis,\" he said, arguing that the health department has neither the time nor the staff to devote as much attention to mosquito control as does the district. Bonta, pointing out that midges are largely the responsibility of county flood control authorities, says residents are mistaken if they think the district will eliminate the midge nuisance. The district is funded with annual property tax assessments of a couple of dollars on every parcel within the district. It would therefore not cost the city anything to relinquish its mosquito duties to the district. But Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, also on the Public Safety Committee, argues that however small the fee, it will cost residents something. \"I\u0027m not particularly receptive to turning it over to the abatement district,\" said Braude, whose shoreline district is within the health department\u0027s territory. He, too, says he is satisfied with the department\u0027s mosquito performance, although he agrees that a case can be made for consolidating mosquito control efforts in the city. It costs the health department about $24,000 a year to run its mosquito program, a sum that would likely be spent on some other city expense were it not used on mosquitoes. Testifying before the Public Safety Committee last month, Bonta complained that much of the district\u0027s information about the city\u0027s program \"is simply incorrect.\" For instance, she said that contrary to the district\u0027s assertions, the department routinely sprays mosquito breeding areas and also uses biological controls, such as mosquito fish, which consume mosquito larvae. Bonta further argues that since it is necessary for her department to monitor mosquito-borne diseases, the city should continue to wage some of Long Beach\u0027s mosquito battles. It might even make sense to have the city take over the third of Long Beach now treated by the district, she said, adding that the costs of that move are being researched.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition RESPONSE TIME OF PASADENA POLICE SHORT OF 6-MINUTE GOAL A city audit has concluded that police failed to respond to emergency calls within the department goal of six minutes nearly half the time during a recent 7-month monitoring period. A manpower shortage was cited as the reason in the audit by city administrators and outside consultants. The audit also concluded that the Police Department should eliminate two of its four helicopters and consider transferring some of the officers from a special neighborhood crime task force to other jobs. According to the audit, officers did not meet the departmental goal of responding within six minutes to crimes that are life-threatening or in progress 48% of the time between July, 1987, and February, 1988. The average delay was one second more than six minutes. Response times ranged from 3 minutes, 16 seconds to 16 minutes, 26 seconds. During the monitoring period, the department had about 56 officers on patrol and was about 10 below the staffing level approved by the city. \"What I don\u0027t understand is why can\u0027t we fill those positions?\" asked city Director Kathryn Nack. \"We have the money, why don\u0027t we have the people?\" Police Chief James M. Robenson said the department has had a difficult time finding officers. He said it is difficult to find qualified candidates since only about one in 75 is accepted. Many potential applicants prefer to work on smaller suburban forces, he said. Pasadena has tried to solve the problem by recruiting on college campuses around the country and setting up a toll-free telephone number to provide employment information, Robenson said. But Robenson said the audit was wrong in assuming the shortage has affected the department\u0027s response time to emergency calls. He said those calls are given top priority and even if a dozen new officers were hired, it would not significantly lower response times. More patrol officers, he said, would have a greater impact on less serious calls, which are sometimes delayed while police respond to emergency calls. Robenson also said the audit was misleading because it did not count the response time of police helicopters, which he said can reach the scene of any crime in the city in less than a minute. He added that even if the audit were accurate, a delay of a few seconds was still well within an acceptable range. \"Sure I\u0027d like to have the quickest response of any place, but we\u0027re talking about just a few seconds,\" he said. \"If the trend is between six and seven minutes, I feel we\u0027re delivering at least what we should.\" Police in Pomona, which is comparable to Pasadena in population, has an average response time of 7 minutes, 50 seconds. Pomona has 94 patrol officers. The audit, which will be presented to the Board of Directors Jan. 10, was part of a series of reports commissioned by the city to study the operation of all its major departments, such as water and power and public works. The audit largely praised the Police Department for its responsiveness to the community and innovative approach to law enforcement. \"The Pasadena Police Department can be classified as an organization on the move,\" the audit stated. \"Based on our analysis, the project team found no major efficiency or effectiveness problems.\" Mayor William Thomson said he was pleased with the results of the audit, saying it confirmed his belief that \"we have a first-rate department.\" But Director William Paparian said the audit\u0027s conclusions led him to believe the department has gotten away from the basics of law enforcement to pursue \"sexier\" and more high-profile projects. \"We ought to be going to more substance than flash,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve gone off on these sexy approaches and I think it\u0027s time we get back to the basics.\" One example, Paparian said, was the Neighborhood Crime Task Force, a special police unit formed to fight neighborhood crime and drug dealing, particularly in northwest Pasadena. The audit praised the task force for its high number of arrests and convictions, but noted the number of felony and drug arrests have dropped. Implications for Task Force The audit team, which included city administrators and outside consultants, said the smaller number of arrests for serious crimes may be the first sign the 3-year-old task force has outlived its usefulness. The audit recommended the department consider transferring some of the task force\u0027s 18 officers to other jobs. But Robenson said cutting back the task force would be a \"disservice\" to the northwest community, which still has the highest crime rate in the city. While the number of felony and drug arrests did drop by about 20% during an 18-month period ending in 1987, the number of cases filed for prosecution remained the same, the audit said. Robenson said the task force allows the department to focus on combatting crime in the neighborhoods by freeing up officers for foot patrols throughout the city and undercover drug enforcement. Helicopter Unit The audit also raised concerns about the efficiency of the department\u0027s helicopter unit, which auditors said has more helicopters than it needs. The unit now has four helicopters, one of which is primarily used to ferry city officials and demonstrate the capabilities of helicopters to police officers. Other cities of comparable size have two helicopters to accomplish the same work, according to the audit. \"I don\u0027t know why we need to have our own air force with a budget of $1.1 million,\" Paparian said. \"I\u0027d like to see us spend that money on bread-and-butter stuff like more neighborhood patrols.\" The audit recommended selling two of the helicopters for an annual savings of as much as $640,000. But Robenson said to achieve those savings the department would have to eliminate daytime flights and cut back flight time from 3,750 hours a year to 1,170. He said the department is spending about the same as other departments that have just two helicopters. For example, he said, Riverside police spent $1.3 million and Newport police spent $900,000 last year to operate two helicopters. Robenson said having four helicopters is critical to the department\u0027s patrol strategy because they can reach the scene of a crime faster than a patrol car and can cover much more territory.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition SANTA FE SPRINGS FIRMS CREATE AID NETWORK UNDER EMERGENCY PLAN After the dust from the Whittier Narrows earthquake on Oct. 1, 1987, finally settled, city officials began hearing from concerned business owners. The earthquake knocked out telephone service, preventing the city\u0027s 3,500 businesses from reporting emergencies such as fires and medical problems. The nearly 80,000 workers who commute to Santa Fe Springs daily clogged streets for hours. At one point it took nearly 2 hours for a city fire truck to travel about 3 miles from the fire station to City Hall, said Fire Chief Robert Wilson. \"Communications were terrible,\" Wilson said. \"We were overwhelmed. We really had no idea what was going on in the city.\" The safety and satisfaction of the business community is especially important in Santa Fe Springs, where 85% of the land is zoned for commercial use. \"In the daytime, we could have major problems just dealing with the numbers of people\" who work here, said Assistant City Manager Fred Latham. \"And if this were to occur at night, we could have unoccupied buildings with substantial damage and not be aware of it.\" Partnership Formed As a result of these concerns, the public and private sectors in Santa Fe Springs have formed a partnership to design an emergency-preparedness plan that would reduce the burden on city government in the three days after a disaster. The Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce suggested that businesses establish their own emergency communications network. City officials agreed, and in the past year the chamber\u0027s suggestion has evolved into an elaborate plan. Though supervised by the city, businesses will turn to one another instead of the city when disaster strikes. With just 15,000 residents concentrated in a 2-square-mile area, the best option for Santa Fe Springs is to rely on businesses in the other seven square miles of town to provide their own emergency support, said Tony Ferrara, a supervisor at the California Specialized Training Institute. The institute is a division of the state Office of Emergency Services which is helping a committee of city and chamber officials prepare the plan. \"The city told the businesses, \u0027We don\u0027t have the traditional support systems. So you are it,\u0027 \" Ferrara said. \"This was a tremendous buy-in on the part of industry . . . and the city was willing to depart from the norm as far as their association with the private sector. What they are doing is making use of what they have, and what they have is industry.\" If an earthquake were to happen once the city\u0027s plan is in place, this is how businesses would respond: Command Posts They would immediately report to one of four command posts, where an area coordinator would report any emergencies to city officials by radio. Workers on foot or riding bicycles would check neighboring businesses for injured employees or other problems. Once damages are assessed, workers would turn to a handbook to see where emergency supplies are available. Under the cooperative plan, a food warehouse might agree to donate food and another firm might provide blankets or plywood for boarding up broken windows. \"We are asking businesses to go beyond their own walls and hold hands,\" Latham said. \"It\u0027s really exciting.\" Once post-disaster emergencies have been taken care of, the plan calls for businesses to resume operations quickly. For example, a business using propane might not be able to reach a supplier in Los Angeles, so the plan would include a list of propane suppliers in the immediate area. \"An important element is getting the businesses running again,\" Wilson said. \"They\u0027re producing resources that can be used for the recovery effort.\" Disaster Assistance The plan also calls for familiarizing business owners with government disaster assistance loans and grants. Rick Landis, president of the Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce, said the plan has met with an enthusiastic reception from the business community. \"There are a lot of resources in this city, and most businesses are willing to share them,\" Landis said. \"We\u0027re going to wind up with a business community that is really well prepared. . . . We feel we are on the cutting edge of emergency preparedness.\" It will be about three years before the system is completely in place, Latham said. Next month, the chamber plans to mail questionnaires to all Santa Fe Springs businesses, requesting their participation and outlining information about operating hours, existing emergency plans and other relevant facts, he said. By the end of 1989, organizers plan to have the handbook distributed and command posts set up. In 1990, they plan to complete training in disaster loan procedures, first aid and other emergency measures. Santa Fe Springs will assign one Fire Department employee to supervise the effort, Wilson said. The City Council, impressed by the efforts of the business community, has asked city staff to develop a similar emergency response system for residential areas, Latham said. Ferrara hopes that Santa Fe Springs\u0027 business network can become a model for other cities and counties with large industrial bases. \"The concept is that over a period of time, there will be a network of communication and support,\" Latham said, \"so when an emergency does occur, the relationships will automatically be in place.\"",

Mayor Kell is typically being demagogic when he says there is \"plenty of blame to go around\" for the mushrooming apartment houses where single-family dwellings stood a few months ago. He and three other members of the City Council alone approved this sellout. What Kell really means is there is plenty of blame to try to spread around, which he is, of course, trying to do. Yet even Kell is exceeded in artful dodging by Councilwoman Jan Hall, who managed to lead both the city of Long Beach and the RTD into disaster simultaneously and then duck responsibility for both. Not mentioned in your coverage was the incredible ineptitude displayed by Kell, Hall and company, in the matter of the airport and the Pandora\u0027s box of noise and pollution that has opened up. While other cities have been going in the direction of placing airports away from city centers and population, our council, of course, is going in precisely the opposite direction and trying to expand one in a prime residential section of our city! One who has followed the City Hall circus would, of course, expect a \"solution\" from Kell and Hall for the parking problem they have created; they want to harass a tiny, politically unprotected minority of small boat owners who cause probably less than one-tenth of 1% of the problem (\"Long Beach Thinks Again About Paving of Greenbelt,\" Times, Dec. 4). Thus they can continue to flail around while giving the superficial impression of doing something. Finally, to call the Long Beach Planning Department ineffectual is to be unduly charitable. They have proven themselves to be the Keystone Kops of urban planning. One fears the inmates are running the asylum. Please keep your spotlight focused; it may perchance do some good. JACK L.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition SIGHTLESS TWINS GIVE LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF ROSE PARADE While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio commentators will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses. John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for the third time from high in the press box. The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC, Pasadena City College\u0027s radio station, a program that will be carried all over the country via satellite. Sighted Listeners, Too Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC since 1980, the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience. After much preparation, including \"feeling tours\" of floats under construction, they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes they have felt. But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the Gassmans\u0027 spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well. \"We\u0027ve had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio,\" Shirk said. He called the twins \"extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses of humor.\u0027 Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade\u0027s \"informational\" station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and after the parade broadcast. As on the past two New Year\u0027s Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on Orange Grove and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes. Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, \"When our fingertips freeze, the Braille becomes fuzzy. That\u0027s like reading a printed page and the lights go out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they still froze. Now we\u0027re going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually, it\u0027s fun to figure out what to do.\" In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their observations while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information and details than they have ever needed. Acting as Spotter In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup. \"He tells us to speed up or slow down,\" John said. \"Anyone knows that when you\u0027re describing a float and a band goes by, there\u0027s something wrong.\" They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast, questioning and answering to \"keep it conversational.\" \"We want to be talking to people, not at them,\" John said. \"Talking at people is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like we\u0027re reading. \"If we use humor, it\u0027s not conscious, but if there\u0027s something funny and its in good taste, well. . . . \" They have had years of practice, anticipating each other\u0027s comments and keeping up a lively patter. Their weekly radio show, \"Same Time, Same Station,\" is on KPCC every Sunday from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of 13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, \"Suspense\" and \"Fibber McGee and Molly.\" Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows. Their collection is what John called \"medium-sized, but all high-quality\" recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually growing as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country. They are identical twins who live together in their own home in Whittier, where they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio Hondo College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts of a \"Top 40s\" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. They are not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead to jobs. Second Nature They said their parents, both of whom have died, \"purposely taught us that we were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature.\" They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition SUPER QUIZ DROPS \u0027CRUSOE\u0027 AFTER RACISM COMPLAINT \"Robinson Crusoe\" has been thrown overboard by the planners of the Los Angeles Unified School District\u0027s Sixth Annual Academic Pentathlon after a teacher complained about racial stereotyping in the literary classic. In October the district notified coaches preparing middle-school students for the districtwide academic competition that the Super Quiz would deal with Daniel Defoe\u0027s 18th-Century novel about shipwreck and survival. A few weeks later, the coaches were sent a memo saying the book had been withdrawn and replaced by Jules Verne\u0027s classic \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\" No reason was given for the change. According to Lorna Round, the district\u0027s associate superintendent of instruction, the Defoe book was dropped from the pentathlon after a coach in a predominantly black school objected to \"the blatantly racist attitude pervasive throughout the book.\" Round declined to identify the coach, who is on winter break, without first obtaining his permission. Round said the coach had objected to passages such as the following description of Friday, the black man who ends Crusoe\u0027s decades of isolation: \"He was a comely handsome fellow perfectly well made. . . . His hair was long and black, not curled like wool. . . . The color of his skin was not quite black . . . and yet not of an ugly yellow, nauseous tawny as the Brazilians . . . his nose small, not flat like the Negroes.\" Not Pulled From Shelves Round said the staff agreed with the coach\u0027s contention that \"a book which reinforces negative racial stereotypes should not be the centerpiece of a districtwide competition.\" Round emphasized that the book had not been pulled from library shelves nor censored in any other way, only dropped from the list of material to be used in the competition. The pentathlon will be held Feb. 25 at Fairfax High School. \"We\u0027re not saying \u0027Don\u0027t read it,\u0027 \" Round said. However, she said she and other staff members felt that, given the uncomplimentary characterization of blacks and other minorities in the book, it needed to be taught carefully. A specific concern, she said, was that the book\u0027s treatment of minorities might negatively affect the self-esteem of some minority students. Given the deadline imposed by the competition, she said, \"we didn\u0027t feel we had time to talk to all the teachers (about ways the book might be constructively taught).\" Round said the district hoped to develop a lesson plan for the book that would address the troublesome issues it raises. A few coaches called the district to protest the change in books, Round said. Most were distressed because they had already begun working with their students on \"Robinson Crusoe.\" Both books are recommended for study by middle-school students by the state Department of Education. Janet R. Cole, a state education official, lauded the district for its handling of the matter. \"I think it\u0027s wonderful that they are sensitive to the community. Both are excellent books. It doesn\u0027t matter which one they use.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition SHOP OWNERS ARE PIONEERS IN REVIVING OLD WEST STYLE; MONTEREY FURNITURE RIDES BACK OUT OF SUNSET That low-slung, wooden couch with cushions covered in Mexican serapes is not cheesy: It\u0027s Monterey, Jack. What? You don\u0027t remember the style of furniture that filled working-class Los Angeles ranch houses in the 1930s and \u002740s, spread East with the lore of Westerns, then met an inglorious end in the rumpus room? Don\u0027t blame Don Shorts and Dolores Fisher. The proprietors of a Ventura antiques shop, they take credit for rekindling interest in Monterey furniture, which is decorated with wrought-iron hinges, hand-painted donkeys, flowers and sombrero-bedecked figures. \"We like to be considered the pioneers in bringing this thing back to light,\" explained Shorts, 54, who co-owns the Old California Store on East Thompson Boulevard with Fisher, 55. Cowboy Style Others may have received more publicity for selling the factory-made furniture that Ojai collector Bob Smith describes as \"a motion-picture version of what cowboys might have had in the way of furniture -- if they had furniture.\" But none of the handful of Monterey dealers has done more to research and promote a style whose history was little known 6 months ago, the couple\u0027s colleagues agree. \"I would certainly give the most credit for the resurrection to Don and Dee,\" said Jack Moore, a Pasadena antiques dealer who for 7 years has traded in the furniture that combines early California, Mexican and Western influences. Shorts and Fisher have turned their 1926 home, which doubles as living quarters and a showroom, into a Monterey monument, with a rotating selection of dining room sets, bedroom sets, living room groupings, Mexican kitsch and at least three photographs of Will Rogers. They also publish a newsletter on the furniture, serve as hosts at \"openings\" in the homes of clients, and organize outings to such shrines of Monterey furniture as Rogers\u0027 1921 ranch house in Pacific Palisades. The couple even organized a museum exhibition last summer of the ersatz cowboy furniture. \"Monterey: An Exhibition of California Rancho Furniture, Pottery and Art\" filled one story and part of a second at the Santa Monica Heritage Museum. An Introduction The exhibition enhanced the furniture\u0027s status as a collectible by popularizing it, antiques dealers say. It also introduced the style to Kenneth Trapp, a curator of decorative arts at the Oakland Museum. Now he plans to include it in an upcoming exhibition of California Craftsman furniture. \"It struck me as wonderfully ludicrous,\" Trapp said. And so it is. Consider the chaise lounge done up frontier-style, with a canvas canopy to complete the covered-wagon look. Or the grand piano fashioned out of wood so rough-hewn that it looks as if it had been dragged through a mountain pass. In the last 2 years, the Westward-ho look has become Westward-haute. Magazines such as Metropolitan Home and Better Homes and Gardens have praised Monterey furniture, tony Los Angeles shops have taken to selling it, and one shop even peddles modern-day reproductions of it. The limelight also has fallen on the designer of the Monterey line, George Mason, an 81-year-old retiree now living in San Luis Obispo. Instead of making couches and chairs, these days Mason occupies himself with painting, and lately his favorite subject has been his own rediscovered furniture. Paintings Exhibited Earlier in December, Shorts and Fisher mounted an exhibition of the folksy paintings at their store. Mason\u0027s painted renditions of Monterey furniture sold briskly for as much as $185 apiece, while about 50 collectors competed for his attention. \"I came down from Pismo Beach just to shake his hand,\" gushed Patricia Slater, 53, a designer of what she described as \"cowboy punk\" furniture. It almost seemed like the good old days to Mason, whose father ran the Los Angeles factory where his designs were made. In 1929, executives of Barker Brothers Furniture asked the pair to design and manufacture a line that would bear the Monterey name and would suit the ranch houses springing up all over Southern California. The Masons were told to take their cue from a settee that appeared in the background of a Warner Brothers movie, \"Old Arizona.\" Made from Oregon alder, stained in six colors and shaped into about 120 pieces, each quirkier than the last one, the furniture was a hit, as were a host of copycat lines: La Fiesta, Coronado, Ranch-O. Monterey-style furniture spread to homes in Texas, New York, Chicago and Florida. Changing Times In 1943, Mason was drafted; his father died, and Monterey came to a grinding halt. After the war, tastes changed. \"Everyone threw it out and got chrome and glass,\" said Betty Gold, who stocked her much-publicized Melrose Avenue furniture shop, Territory, with Monterey purchased from Shorts and Fisher. The distinctive furniture became, as one collector says, \"grist for garage sales.\" Enter Shorts, who 10 years ago quit his job as a high school history teacher in Santa Barbara to devote himself full-time to his hobby of collecting old paintings and furnishings. The homemade crafts and pottery that sold at roadside stands throughout Southern California in the 1930s had begun to attract his attention. Typically decorated with sombrero-topped men either asleep beneath cactuses or leading stubborn mules, they reminded him of his South Gate childhood. \"I was a \u002730s Southern California child and have never outgrown it,\" he said. Shorts discovered Monterey furniture and liked how well it matched the knickknacks he was acquiring. He bought the furniture first for himself, because he did not think it would sell. In fact, it was not until 2 years ago that the shop began to deal exclusively in Monterey-style furniture and its trappings. Since then, sales have tripled, he said, and he delves into a network of thrift shops and secondhand stores to replenish his stock. Despite all this, Shorts was not sure until recently what he was selling. He had noticed that the pieces were all branded with the same label -- \"Monterey\" -- but unraveling their origins proved difficult. One person told him that the furniture came from Monterrey, Mexico. No, another said, Monterey, Calif. But a Monterey, Calif., antiques dealer put that notion to rest. \"Oh, that\u0027s what we call Carmel furniture,\" she told him. It was not until a friend found an old Barker Brothers catalogue that Shorts had a tangible lead. Lacking details, however, Shorts wrongly concluded that the company had manufactured the furniture, not merely sold it. Error Noted Mason, the furniture\u0027s real manufacturer, noted the error when he read an article about the Santa Monica exhibition. \"It made me so angry,\" remembers Mason, who complained to the museum\u0027s director, Tobi Smith. She was only too happy to hear from him. Smith enlisted both Mason and Shorts to write chapters in an upcoming catalogue of the exhibition, which will include an essay by Smith\u0027s husband, Bob, the Ojai collector, who also teaches furniture design at Cal State Northridge. Titled \"My Mexicana Nirvana,\" Bob Smith\u0027s piece hails the furniture as \"a unique manifestation of Western urban culture.\" \"Woven with mythology, fantasy, eclecticism and pretension, Monterey furniture is synonymous with Southern Californians\u0027 collective search for a meaningful identity -- a population with no heritage and little in common,\" he wrote. Bob Smith believes that modern furniture buyers are attracted to Monterey because it tickles the modern fancy. \"As an unabashedly eclectic and nostalgic movement, Postmodernism says it\u0027s all right to borrow style or fake material if you are honest about it,\" he said. And \"Monterey Furniture is honestly fake.\" Even honestly fake furniture comes with a price. A dining room set sells for $3,500 at the California shop, which is still less expensive than a fine chair from the Arts and Crafts Movement but is much more than the $79 Mason remembers the same pieces selling for originally. But for collectors, such as Alan Erenberg, 39, the cost is worth it. He says the furniture perfectly fits the hacienda-inspired architecture so prevalent in Southern California. A vice president of Serta, the mattress company, he and his former wife, Lori, replaced their collection of \u002750s furnishings with Monterey when they bought a 1920s California ranch house. When they recently divorced, he said he \"got custody\" of the furniture, which now decorates his Spanish Revival apartment in Venice. That does not mean, however, that everybody loves Monterey. Some of Gloria List\u0027s clients at Nonesuch Gallery in Santa Monica \"find it garish and klutzy,\" she said. And even converts can tire of Monterey\u0027s quirky style. Two of Shorts\u0027 best customers, he sadly reports, recently tossed out their Monterey collection in favor of crisp, contemporary furnishings. But Mason is glad that at least some see the world through his eyes. After returning from military service, he longed for the Monterey days. First he represented another furniture company; then he ran a store that sold Colonial furniture. \"I was an unhappy guy,\" he said.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition STATE DROPS THREAT TO FINE WHITTIER ON WASTE MISHAP The state has dropped its threat to fine the city up to $30,000 in connection with a June mishap at a household toxic-waste roundup after city officials warned that they would refuse to hold more roundups. The state Department of Health Services cited Whittier for failing to report to the state that a contractor hired to manage the roundup created a small toxic cloud by mixing several types of acids together. By law, the state should have been notified within 60 days. Jim Marxen, a spokesman for the Department of Health Services, said the state decided against the fine because it might scare off other cities conducting toxic-waste roundups. In such roundups residents dispose of household chemicals such as paint thinners and insecticides. About 400 households participated in Whittier\u0027s roundup. \"We\u0027re not after the money,\" Marxen said. \"What we\u0027re after is having them comply with the law and understand that they have violated the law. . . . The public airing of their fault was felt to be enough of a punishment.\" City\u0027s Position Michael Woods, an attorney who handled the case for Whittier, said the city was \"not simply going to roll over\" and take the fine. The city\u0027s position has been that any fine as a result of the accident should be paid by the contractor, Omega Recovery Services, which was paid $60,000 for the job, Woods said. City officials also told the state that if Whittier were fined, the city would refuse to conduct any more toxic roundups, he said. \"If the city was going to end up getting slapped with a fine for its responsible effort (to hold the roundup), then why take that risk?\" Woods asked. In an out-of-court settlement of the issue, city officials agreed to: Make presentations to other cities in the Los Angeles area about the correct way to run a household toxic-waste roundup; Provide extra training over the next eight months to city employees involved in handling hazardous wastes. Send the state within 60 days a detailed plan for any future hazardous-waste roundups. Request state approval at least 60 days before any future roundup. The state normally requires only 30-days\u0027 notice from agencies who want to organize such events. \u0027Going to Be Watching\u0027 \"This is just as serious as when we were talking about the fine,\" Marxen, the health services spokesman, said of the agreement. \"We\u0027re going to be watching (Whittier officials) pretty closely in the future because of their track record.\" During the roundup, Dennis O\u0027Meara of Omega Recovery Services mixed several types of potent nitric acid in a 55-gallon drum.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition THE RAILEY CASE; THE BRUTAL ATTACK ON THE POPULAR PASTOR\u0027S WIFE AND HIS SUICIDE ATTEMPT BECAME DALLAS\u0027 MOST HAUNTING AND SENSATIONAL MYSTERY IN A DECADE Bewildered friends and followers would recall that he looked tired and depressed, still grief-stricken and mystified over the savage assault on his wife. Little more than a week had passed since he found her comatose on the garage floor, choked senseless and left for dead. She had not regained consciousness. Now, in the early evening hours of April 30, 1987, the intense, balding man excused himself and disappeared into a private hospital suite. He locked and chained the door, sat down with pen and paper and began composing a chilling letter. \"There is a demon inside my soul,\" he wrote. \"It has always been there. My demon tries to lead me down paths I do not want to follow. At times that demon has lured me into doing things I do not want to do. \". . . My demon has finally gotten the upper hand.\" When security officers broke in the next morning, they found him sprawled across the bed. He was alive but unconscious and in critical condition. Nearby were empty bottles of prescription drugs and his rambling letter, which began with instructions for his funeral and ended thusly: \"I have finally made the decision to take care of myself. I have grown weak. God has remained strong. Therein lies your hope. I have none. \"Walker L. Railey.\" The vicious attack on Walker Railey\u0027s wife and his ensuing suicide attempt devastated three families, split a church and outraged a city. For Peggy Railey was by no means an ordinary homemaker, and her husband was perhaps Dallas\u0027 most dynamic and socially conscious young minister. At 39, Walker Railey reigned as the senior pastor of the city\u0027s 6,000-member First United Methodist Church and loomed as a rising star in his mainstream Protestant denomination. The news of the suicide attempt swept through town, nowhere more devastatingly than at First Methodist, where Railey\u0027s flock was already reeling from the attempted murder. \u0027Keep Him in Our Prayers\u0027 His chief assistant, the Rev. Gordon Casad, told the congregation the next Sunday, \"We must remember our pastor and the troubling of his mind and spirit and keep him in our prayers.\" Asked if Railey was now a suspect, Park Stearns, supervisor in the Dallas FBI office, replied: \"This is a big no comment.\" Although police refused to reveal the contents of Railey\u0027s letter, they described it as an apparent suicide note. And they redoubled their efforts to review with the convalescing minister what happened the night his wife was attacked. A fellow pastor, the Rev. David Shawyer of Plymouth Park Methodist Church, said, \"I\u0027m praying that it is not what it looks like. I\u0027m praying that what the police are suggesting could never be true. \"I\u0027m praying this will all come out some other way.\" Latest Twist in Mystery Railey\u0027s attempt on his own life was only the latest twist in what would be called Dallas\u0027 most haunting and sensational mystery in a decade. One unrestrained commentator called the attempted murder the city\u0027s most extraordinary crime since the assassination of President Kennedy. Peggy Railey survived, but only barely so. Comatose, she could not identify her assailant. Several anonymous, typewritten death threats preceded the attack, apparently provoked by Railey\u0027s strong sermons and public statements against racial prejudice and injustice. But friends said Peggy Railey did not frighten easily, and she had encouraged her husband not to soften his stand. The last letter was slipped under the door of a church office just prior to Easter Sunday services. It said: \"EASTER IS WHEN CHRIST AROSE, BUT YOU ARE GOING DOWN.\" Wore Bulletproof Vest Under the stern scrutiny of security officers, Railey delivered his Easter sermon wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes. It would be his last appearance in the pulpit of First Methodist\u0027s historic old sanctuary. He hammered the congregation with a theme of death and resurrection that morning. \"You\u0027re going to die,\" he said, pointing his finger at parishioners. \"You\u0027re going to die,\" he repeated. \"I\u0027m going to die.\" Police and church officials first theorized that the attempt on Peggy Railey\u0027s life was some kind of grotesque retaliation for her husband\u0027s outspokenness. With his wife in critical condition, Railey stationed himself outside her hospital room, interrupting his vigil only for a trip downtown to give investigators an account of his activities the night of April 21. Noticed Open Garage Door He said he\u0027d spent the evening doing research at Southern Methodist University libraries. Returning home about 12:40 a.m., he said, he noticed that a door to the darkened two-car garage was partly open. Driving inside with his headlights on, he found his wife lying on the floor, writhing in convulsions. Her face was puffy and discolored and she was frothing at the mouth. He said the children, Ryan, 5, and Megan, 2, were inside the house and unharmed. After the interview, Capt. John Holt, 37, the tall, sandy-haired supervisor of crimes against persons, told reporters the questioning was routine. \"We don\u0027t have any indicators that would point to him as a suspect,\" he said. Arranged for Hospital Suite Railey returned to the hospital to arrange for a suite near his wife. He spent the day greeting a parade of visitors who expressed shock, sorrow and support. Among those who came to share their grief that day was a striking frosted blonde who carried a single red rose and disappeared into Railey\u0027s hospital suite. With the investigation in full swing and the FBI trying to identify the source of the death threats, Railey continued his hospital vigil under heavy police protection. \"He\u0027s just numb. . . . He\u0027s overwhelmed by it,\" said Ralph Shannon, a longtime church member. If Railey was silent, his ministerial colleagues were not. Rabbi Joseph Ofseyer of Congregation Shearith Israel said that Railey had suffered for his message of justice and equality but that the religious community would not \"be cowed into silence\" and \"permit such a person to stand alone.\" Almost lost or overlooked in the outcry was an observation by Police Lt. Ron Waldrop that the abusive letters appeared to be the work of one individual and not the concerted effort of a white supremacist group. \"There\u0027s no central theme,\" he added. A short time later, the FBI determined that the death threats had been written on an office typewriter at First Methodist. Walker Railey\u0027s rise to clerical prominence seemed almost preordained from his turbulent childhood days in Owensboro, Ky., a coal mining town on the south bank of the Ohio River. The oldest of three children, Railey grew up a nonsmoker and nondrinker who delivered his first sermon at age 17 and became something of a circuit preacher while a history major at Western Kentucky University. He attended Vanderbilt Divinity School for a year, then headed to Dallas and the Perkins Theological Seminary at Southern Methodist University. It was there, in 1970, that he met Margaret Nicolai, an equally talented, intelligent and religiously dedicated young musician whom everyone called Peggy. She had arrived at SMU from Wisconsin to pursue a master\u0027s degree in organ music. Acquaintances say Peggy recognized early on that young Walker was a man with great ambition and potential but that she was not much taken with him romantically. His persistence won her over and the couple were married in August, 1971. After obtaining a doctor of ministry in 1973, Railey ministered to several rural churches in Oklahoma and then was appointed an associate pastor at First Methodist in Dallas. In 1980, after a stint as a senior minister at a suburban Dallas church, he returned to First Methodist as senior pastor at age 33. Eight Ministers Became Bishops The appointment was the most dramatic step in a meteoric rise. Although not even the largest Methodist church in Dallas, First Methodist had the reputation as the nation\u0027s mother church of Methodism, in no small part because eight of its ministers had gone on to become bishops. Under Railey\u0027s leadership, First Methodist grew and prospered, its membership approaching 6,000 and its annual budget doubling to $2 million. And although Railey himself was short, balding and physically unimposing, his radiant ministry served as a magnet for the young, energetic and socially conscious while not alienating older, more conservative parishioners. He spoke out boldly against those who practiced or condoned racial intolerance. He clashed with a City Council member over what he perceived to be a racist stance on illegal aliens. He challenged President Reagan to take a \"more visible and articulate stand\" for peace and he once said of fundamentalist Jerry Falwell, \"I guarantee he doesn\u0027t speak for the Kingdom of God, let alone the people in it.\" When the threats came, the Raileys seemed to take them in stride. The FBI encouraged Peggy Railey and the children to leave town for a while. Although she went to her parents\u0027 home for four days, she did not seem overly concerned. Diane Yarrington, wife of First Methodist\u0027s minister of music and one of Peggy Railey\u0027s closest friends, said Peggy told her that she and Walker were taking precautions but that they refused to be intimidated. Long before the attack, the Yarringtons and Raileys pledged to care for one another\u0027s children in the event of tragedy. That pledge would soon come due. As Railey and his wife lay near death in the same intensive care unit, police were anxious to talk again with First Methodist\u0027s senior pastor. After his first interview, police found unspecified \"inconsistencies\" in Railey\u0027s account of April 21. Friends in the church hired a tough, no-nonsense criminal defense attorney named Doug Mulder to advise Railey, and as the minister recovered, he wasn\u0027t talking to police. He did, however, speak with reporters. \"To be honest with you . . . I just don\u0027t know anything,\" he told a veteran religion reporter. Later, he told the Associated Press: \"I didn\u0027t attack my wife. I didn\u0027t plan to have someone attack my wife. I didn\u0027t orchestrate a plan to attack my wife. And if I had written the letters, I wouldn\u0027t have written them on a typewriter in the church. But I didn\u0027t write them.\" \u0027I Don\u0027t Understand Why\u0027 He could not rationalize his suicide attempt, which he knew was construed by some as an admission of guilt. \"I don\u0027t understand why I did it, any more than I understand why I lived beyond it.\" Mulder arranged for a private polygraph test, which indicated that Railey did not try to kill his wife. Presumably because of those results, Mulder approved a police-administered examination the next day. That exercise was described as \"inconclusive.\" \"The results showed that he didn\u0027t have anything to do with the attack, nor did he conspire with anyone,\" Mulder said. Though Railey\u0027s followers took new heart, investigators were unimpressed and restated the ongoing request to interview him. Holt accused Mulder of misrepresenting the outcome of the police-administered examination. He suggested that some of Railey\u0027s responses were \"untruthful,\" but refused to elaborate. All but overlooked in the flap over the polygraphs was an unattributed police statement that Railey\u0027s account of his activities the night of April 21 was \"in direct conflict with indisputable evidence.\" The key word was \"indisputable.\" The frosted blonde with the sparkling eyes was no stranger to the congregation at First United Methodist Church. Lucy Papillon grew up in the magnificent sanctuary, the daughter of the Rev. Robert E. Goodrich Jr., a former senior pastor and later a Methodist bishop. A portrait of Goodrich, who died in 1985, hangs in the First Methodist foyer. \"She had that knotted Goodrich chin, his thin, drawn smile, and the dark eyes that were his most distinctive feature -- eyes that seemed remote but also searching and intelligent,\" journalist Larry Wright, a childhood acquaintance, wrote in Texas Monthly. \"It was a strong face, like her father\u0027s, and if in some lights it appeared hard, in others you could detect a vulnerable and even wounded soul who had lived past the point where life surprised her.\" As a youngster, Lucy played the piano in Sunday school and was a cheerleader at an exclusive girls\u0027 school. She entered Southern Methodist University in 1959 to pursue a degree in music education and, four years later, married a Methodist preacher. They were divorced in 1973 after she bore two sons. Worked Variety of Jobs Friends say she worked at a variety of jobs, including a stint as a part-time model. Somewhere along the way she became enamored with psychology. She married and divorced again and, in 1982, received a doctorate in psychology and moved to California to complete her training. She found various jobs in her new field there and reportedly began to visit the Esalen commune. And it was there that Lucy decided to take on her identity as \"Papillon,\" French for butterfly. In 1986 she opened a private psychology practice in Dallas and legally changed her name to Lucy Papillon. On July 14, 1987, Dallas County\u0027s chief prosecutor sat down with police and the FBI and heard for the first time all the facts of the case. Challenged to \u0027Talk or Walk\u0027 His face flushed with anger, his thick mustache almost bristling, Norm Kinne, 53, stormed from the meeting room into a cluster of reporters and challenged Walker Railey, as one headline proclaimed, to \"talk or walk.\" Eyes flashing and his finger jabbing at the nearest of four television cameras, Kinne declared: \"I\u0027m tired of this man fooling with the justice system and the life of his wife. . . . I\u0027m going to tell you, Walker Railey, I\u0027m tired of you messing with the Dallas Police Department, and you\u0027re going to come before the Dallas County grand jury and you\u0027re going to clear up these discrepancies, or you\u0027re going to leave the country!\" Kinne could subpoena Railey to appear before grand jurors, but he had no way to compel him to answer questions if he invoked the constitutional protection against self-incrimination. Nor was it in the fiery prosecutor\u0027s domain to order a reticent Railey out of the country. Photographs Triggered Outburst But at that moment, nobody was foolhardy enough to argue the issue with Kinne. Later that evening, a vaguely contrite Kinne said it was the photographs of Peggy Railey after the attack that so outraged him and triggered the outburst. \"I got irritated because we have a lady here who is a loving wife and mother and who is lying in a hospital more dead than alive,\" he said. \"And we have an alleged pillar of the community who will not talk to us about this.\" Six days before Kinne\u0027s outburst, a Dallas Morning News story linked Lucy Papillon to the Railey case, calling her a potential \"reluctant witness.\" The article said mobile telephone records revealed that Railey called Papillon twice the night of the attack. Railey had neglected to mention those calls in his lengthy interview with police the morning after April 21. Two Calls Placed to Home Phone records also showed that Railey placed two calls to his own home between midnight and 12:30 a.m., the last one about 10 minutes before he reported finding his wife near death on the garage floor. Investigators refused to discuss the significance of the mobile phone records but it seemed safe to assume they somehow represented the \"indisputable evidence\" of inconsistencies in Railey\u0027s story. Later, on the eve of a grand jury meeting on the Railey case, the Morning News reported that Railey had visited Papillon the night his wife was attacked. Inside the jury room, Kinne was eager to confront Railey, although he was certain that the embattled minister would refuse to answer questions and invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. Railey took the Fifth -- 43 times. Knew Nothing About Attack \"I have followed the advice of my lawyer consistently and will consistently do that,\" Railey remarked brusquely when he emerged from the closed-door session. Papillon spent an hour before the panel and, according to her attorney, Phil Burleson, answered every question. She knew nothing about the attack, Burleson said, and then cautioned reporters against drawing conclusions that his client was romantically linked with Railey. But it made no difference. Leaks poured out of the grand jury room that Lucy Papillon was Walker Railey\u0027s mistress. According to those present, Papillon told grand jurors she first met Railey on a religious television show and they became romantically involved in June, 1986, about the same time she changed her name. She said she had accompanied Railey on several ministerial trips and had vacationed with him in California. Nor were their liaisons confined to this country. Papillon revealed that Railey stopped over for a prearranged rendezvous in London while returning from a World Methodist Council meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, in July, 1986. In one particularly chilling disclosure, Lucy said they embraced and kissed in Walker\u0027s hospital suite while Peggy lay near death nearby. Despite the sensational revelations, the grand jury testimony raised almost as many questions as it answered. And the \"indisputable evidence\" remained cloaked in secrecy. \"We still have a lot of discrepancies, but we\u0027re not going to discuss them,\" said Police Lt. Waldrop. \"There is no statue of limitations on attempted murder, and that\u0027s how long we\u0027ll be working on it.\" Eventually, the discrepancies and the indisputable evidence did unfold. On the night of the attack, Railey made several calls from a cellular telephone installed in his car at church expense only hours earlier as a security measure because of anonymous threats. A phone company computer recorded the times. Railey called home at 5:55 p.m. to say he was leaving the office. At 5:58 p.m., he telephoned Papillon and talked for one minute. Arriving home shortly before 6:30 p.m., Railey said he found his wife working on a faulty garage door lock with a bar of soap. Investigators later found no trace of soap on the lock, which was working fine. Railey said he sat on the hood of his wife\u0027s Chrysler and talked with her for several minutes. He told her he intended to spend the evening on a research project at the SMU libraries. He did not change from his business suit and left the house a little after 6:30. At 6:38 p.m., Railey, who never wore a watch, called on the car phone for the time. He said he spent half an hour or so at SMU\u0027s Bridwell Library and was back in his car by 7:26 p.m., at which time he phoned the family baby-sitter and discussed plans for a trip to San Antonio the Raileys planned later in the week. At 7:32 p.m., he phoned Papillon at her home near SMU. He drove directly to her house, where he spent the next 40 minutes. Railey Went Back to Library Railey told a friend later he went there to get some relaxation tapes to help relieve stress. From 8 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Railey was back at Bridwell, where he asked a librarian what time the library closed. At 8:30, Railey, using a pay phone, called home on a private line. Peggy Railey told him she was putting the children to bed. She then called her parents long distance in Tyler and talked from 8:49 p.m. until 9:14 p.m. At 8:53 p.m., Raily bought gas at a Texaco station near campus. After drinking a wine cooler, he said, he returned to Fondren Library, SMU\u0027s main library. But no one saw him there until after 11 p.m. At 9:30 p.m., a jogger in the Raileys\u0027 neighborhood spotted a man in a business suit and street shoes running through a yard south of the Railey home. Between 10:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., a neighbor heard rustling sounds in the alley behind the home. Tried to Leave Business Card Sometime after 11 p.m., a librarian saw Railey at Fondren. Upon leaving at midnight, he attempted to give his business card to a student at the checkout desk. On the back of the card was a message requesting help in finding research information. Railey also noted the time, 10:30 p.m., when in fact it was midnight, the student told police. At 12:03 a.m., Railey called home on the car phone, but this time he used the public line. According to friends, the family seldom answered the public line, which was connected to an answering machine. \"Hi, Babe,\" he said. \"I\u0027m calling you from my mobile phone. Peg, it\u0027s about, oh, I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t have a watch. It\u0027s somewhere between 10:30 and 10:45, somewhere along in there. I worked at Bridwell until they closed and now I\u0027m going to Fondren.\" This could not have been true. He had in fact just left Fondren, according to other accounts. \u0027Lock the Garage Door\u0027 \"I\u0027ll be in about 1. If you want to, go ahead and lock the garage door and I\u0027ll park out front. It really doesn\u0027t matter to me at this point. My concern is that you\u0027re safe. . . .\" This portion of the tape might explain why Peggy Railey would enter the garage that night. Even so, Railey would still have to explain why, if he really intended to speak with his wife, he had called on the public line and left a message. Twenty-three minutes later, Railey phoned the answering machine again, and on this occasion gave the correct time: 12:29. \"Hi, Babe,\" he began. \"It\u0027s 12:29 and I\u0027m on the way home from SMU. . . . Everything really went well. I got a lot accomplished. I had to leave my card with the reference librarian because there was one deal that I couldn\u0027t quite work out. I\u0027m not calling on the private line because I know you\u0027re already asleep, but in case you get up with the kids, I just wanted you to know that I\u0027m on my way home. It\u0027s 12:30. I\u0027ll be home about 12:45. \"Love you. Bye-bye.\" No Sign of a Struggle At just past 12:40, Railey drove into his driveway and found his wife. There was no sign of a struggle. There was no skin under her fingernails to indicate that she had either fought her assailant or scratched herself when grasping at whatever was pulled around her throat. Railey said he determined that the children were safe and notified police. \"Dallas Emergency, Ms. . . ,\" the dispatcher answered. \"This is Walker Railey,\" he interrupted. \"Send the paramedics and police, please.\" An ambulance arrived, along with neighbors. Inside the house, both children were in the living room, Megan watching a silent television screen and Ryan staring blankly ahead. Months later, Kinne told a reporter he thought it possible that Ryan witnessed the attack, but he said the youngster gave investigators inconsistent accounts of what might have happened that night. \"Maybe Daddy did it,\" the boy told investigators once. Doctors transferred Peggy Railey, her body alive but her brain barely functioning, from a Dallas hospital to a nursing home in east Texas so she could be near her parents. Bill and Billie Jo Nicolai live in Tyler, but they had spent almost all day every day in Dallas, about 60 miles away, attending to Peggy\u0027s needs. Though a full-service hospital was no longer required, she remained in a vegetative state from which she might never awaken. Back in Dallas, no sign was posted, but the Raileys\u0027 home was quietly put on the market and sold. Walker Railey voluntarily surrendered his credentials as a minister in the United Methodist Church, and then surrendered control of his wife\u0027s legal affairs to her parents. He granted temporary custody of his children to the friends who had kept them since April 22, John and Diane Yarrington. Mother Assumed Guardianship Billie Jo Nicolai requested that a court grant her guardianship of her daughter, and Railey waived his right to continue in that traditionally spousal role. And then, after the stunning developments and disclosures of mid-November, Railey vanished. \"I know he has some job prospects,\" Yarrington said. Over the next few months, Railey and Dallas reporters played a game of hide-and-seek. In early December, Railey told religion reporter Helen Parmley of the Dallas Morning News in a telephone interview from California that he fled despair, not speculation. And he maintained that he was not abandoning his children. \"In this case, while I am relocating, looking for work, financially strapped, not knowing where I\u0027m going to end up or what I\u0027m going to be doing, everybody involved in this drama believes . . . the most stable, loving, Christian environment they can be in is where they are,\" he said. But before anybody could get themselves too lathered up over Railey\u0027s plight, Dallas Times Herald columnist Laura Miller put a new slant on the case by telling a tale of the anger and indignation of Peggy Railey\u0027s family -- her father and her grandmother. Both believe Railey was behind the attack. The motive? \"A divorced man doesn\u0027t get to be bishop,\" said the grandmother, Ella Renfro. Larry Wright, a contributing editor at Texas Monthly magazine, grew up in the First United Methodist Church in Dallas. His childhood pastor was Robert Goodrich Jr., Lucy Papillon\u0027s father. He left the church once in disenchantment but had been drawn back by Railey\u0027s socially contemporary ministry. Then he had seen the devastation at First Methodist after the attack on Peggy, Walker\u0027s suicide attempt and the minister\u0027s affair with Lucy. So Wright was less a journalist than a confused and angry member of the congregation when he confronted Railey. Did Peggy know about his affair with Lucy? \"We -- that never came up,\" Railey stammered. She didn\u0027t know? \"I can only say it never emerged.\" Did she suspect? \"I have no way of knowing, regarding that, that she suspected at all, about anything.\" Changing the subject, Railey revealed he had slipped into the First Methodist sanctuary to attend funeral services for a family friend. Some of his former parishioners avoided him but most embraced him. \u0027They Could Feel Pain\u0027 \"They could feel my pain,\" Railey said, crying. He said he also felt love. Did you feel a sense of shame, Wright asked. \"I felt a great need to be forgiven, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re talking about.\" Wright decided that was as much of a concession as he was likely to get. But before departing, he said he could not construct an innocent man out of Railey\u0027s behavior. The journalist recounted Railey\u0027s misleading testimony to the police, his avoidance of the grand jury and his inexplicable actions on the night of the attack. \u0027I Think You Are Guilty\u0027 \"I think you are a guilty person,\" Wright said. \"I hear what you\u0027re saying,\" Railey replied. Wright did not know what to think. Railey failed to absorb his blunt accusation, choosing instead to analyze it with detachment. \"I\u0027m aware that nobody can sit down with all the facts that are supposedly known . . . and just make it all fit. That\u0027s a frustration that everyone has felt, including me,\" Railey said. \"Confess,\" Wright urged him. \"It will haunt you forever, it will drive you crazy.\" \"I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a word of advice, a backhand comfort or what,\" Railey said. \"I\u0027m not guilty. I didn\u0027t do it. I don\u0027t feel tormented by the guilt of what I didn\u0027t do.\" On Feb. 2, Billie Jo Nicolai filed a legal bombshell in civil court, accusing Railey of \"maliciously\" attempting to kill his wife and orchestrating a \"clumsy attempt\" to cover his actions with a phony alibi. The lawsuit sought damages for \"physical and mental pain, disfigurement, anguish and physical impairment\" on behalf of Mrs. Nicolai\u0027s comatose daughter. Concern over the cost of Peggy Railey\u0027s medical expenses was the overriding reason for the action, but the family\u0027s decision was also emotional, said Billie Jo Nicolai\u0027s attorney, Bill Arnold. \u0027They Are Bitter\u0027 \"They are bitter,\" he said. \"They are angry.\" Ted Nicolai, Peggy\u0027s younger brother, revealed that Railey had visited his wife no more than three times and that after a Christmas visit with his two children, Ryan had suffered severe emotional problems. Kinne, Dallas\u0027 chief prosecutor, had sent an investigator to question Ryan about the night of April 21, and the youngster talked freely about almost everything. But whenever the investigator asked about the attack, Ryan would tune her out. He would turn his back and try to leave the room. Railey moved to California, to a Victorian flat not far from San Francisco Bay. The rent reportedly was $1,600, and both he and Papillon signed the lease. Initial attempts to serve Railey with legal notice of the Nicolai civil suit were unsuccessful. Eventually, he was spotted at a hotel, and papers were slapped under the windshield wiper of a car driven by Papillon, with Railey apparently slumped down inside. Precisely one year after the events of April, 1987, a state district judge ruled that Walker Railey \"intentionally, knowingly, maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle his wife\" and cover up his actions with a \"false alibi.\" Judge John Whittington issued a preliminary civil judgment on April 22, 1988, holding Railey financially liable for the injuries to his wife. The extent of damages would be determined later by a jury. The ruling, although significant, had no bearing on the criminal investigation. Whittington\u0027s action came after Railey failed to respond to legal notices of the suit. The judge said Railey, by his technical default, had admitted all the allegations. Fled Bay Area Railey could no longer be found. Under siege from the media, he broke the lease on the San Francisco \"love nest\" he shared with Papillon on her visits from Dallas. It appeared he had fled the Bay Area altogether. \"The court can issue a subpoena that compels him to come answer my questions,\" Arnold said. \"But today, I have less of an idea where he is than at any time since this case started.\" In June, doctors reported a slight improvement in Peggy Railey\u0027s condition and she was returned to Dallas and placed in the Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation. Dr. William Parker, the institute\u0027s medical director, said she could turn her head and hear, but could not process what she heard. \"If we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a response that could be interpreted as functional, then we would continue to try, through repetition, to improve on that,\" he said. Condition Downgraded Parker said he didn\u0027t think his team of specialists would be able to determine whether Peggy Railey would ever communicate again. \"I think the odds are probably going to be against it, but time is the only thing that\u0027s going to tell,\" he said. After more than a year in a vegetative state, doctors downgraded her condition to a \"persistent vegetative state,\" meaning, as a neurosurgeon explained, that her chances for recovery were \"nil.\" After two months in Dallas, she was quietly returned to the nursing home in Tyler where her parents resumed their tender, but apparently hopeless, daily care. Norm Kinne sat puffing his pipe in the district attorney\u0027s office and reflecting on the Railey case, his opinions no less candid than when he first viewed the terrible pictures of Peggy Railey\u0027s wounds. \"This guy\u0027s a liar,\" Kinne said. \"He\u0027s trying to cover his tracks. He wasn\u0027t where he was at the time he says he was. Now the question is, if he wasn\u0027t there, where was he? \"The conclusion that everybody\u0027s drawn is that he was home choking out his wife. \"But that doesn\u0027t necessarily follow. There\u0027s no proof he was at the scene at the time she was strangled. There\u0027s no evidence that he strangled her or that he knew who strangled her or that he arranged or participated in any way.\" No Concrete Evidence That\u0027s not to say Kinne didn\u0027t think about prosecuting Walker Railey. He visualized presenting all the evidence that showed Railey lied, that he contrived an alibi and that he told no one of visiting his girlfriend that night. But with a defense move for an instructed verdict of innocent, the judge might ask, \"Where is the evidence that he choked his wife?\" Kinne said. The trial would probably be over before it began. As 1988 drew to an end, Kinne had not surrendered hope that the case might someday be solved, but any possibility was a long shot. Peggy Railey might miraculously recover and identify her assailant, or even young Ryan Railey might have seen something and be able to talk about it. Nothing Incriminating Lucy Papillon might eventually shed light on the case, but Kinne once pointed out that she had said nothing incriminating \"since we don\u0027t have adultery laws anymore.\" For Kinne, Walker Railey remained the ultimate enigma. \"The last thing you\u0027d expect from a guy like him would be to give up his wife and kids and flit off to California. Just say to hell with it and take off. It\u0027s just not what you\u0027d expect from a man of his stature. \"It gives every indication of guilt, whether he is guilty or not.\" Railey Didn\u0027t Show On Dec. 5, Judge Whittington heard testimony in a one-day trial to determine if Walker Railey should pay damages to the Nicolai family. Railey didn\u0027t show up. The family was awarded $16 million -- half to cover Peggy\u0027s care, half to punish Railey. It was a ruling more of symbolism than substance, a hollow victory. Arnold said he didn\u0027t know where Railey was, or how much money he had. He doubted that his wife\u0027s family would ever collect the $16 million. On videotape, the court watched therapists treating Peggy Railey, who has virtually no body control and a haunting, lifeless look in her eyes. Still, her sister-in-law, Linda Nicolai, told of an experience at the hospital one day that suggested the depth of Peggy Railey\u0027s anguish. As Peggy\u0027s wheelchair went down the hall, she passed a man exercising with a cord similar to what police believe was used to choke Peggy. Peggy Railey began sweating, hyperventilating and rubbing her arms together. Linda Nicolai added: \"She kept looking at me . . . with this wild look on her face and trying to tell me something.\"",

Brittan, who resigned after leaking a secret document in 1986, was granted a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, as was sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Also on the list, mostly compiled on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\u0027s government, were newly dubbed knight Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of N. M. Rothschild \u0026 Sons and a member of the well-known banking family\u0027s British branch, and British Beekeeping Society Vice Chairman William Hooper, named a Member of the Order of the British Empire. Actor Peter Cushing, known for horror films and for portraying Sherlock Holmes, was made an Officer of the Order. Among several athletes honored was six-time world darts champion Eric Bristow, who became a Member of the Order and the first in his field to be so recognized. -- Bandleader Cab Calloway, who had to cancel a New Year\u0027s Eve appearance in Chicago because of illness, relayed greetings to his fans through his wife, Nuffie. \"I wish everyone a Happy New Year,\" she quoted the \"prince of hi-de-ho\" as saying after she visited him at White Plains (N.Y.) Hospital Center. Calloway has been listed in critical but stable condition since emergency surgery for unspecified abdominal troubles that caused him to collapse Dec. 21 during a concert tour in Japan. Nuffie Calloway said her husband, 81, \"thanks everyone for their calls, flowers, letters and expressions of love, and he expects to feel better any minute.\" -- As he packed up office memorabilia recently in Newark, N.J., retiring Democratic Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. looked back on his 40 years in Congress. He recalled rushing past reporters after the Judiciary Committee he chaired voted articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, saying he went into a cubbyhole office, telephoned his wife and wept. Rodino, 79, pointed proudly to photographs of himself with President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Democrat Donald M. Payne will succeed Rodino, becoming the state\u0027s first black congressman.

In the oil price heyday of the 1970s, Saudi Muslims flocked to the kingdom\u0027s air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the desert for the great tourist capitals -- Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles, the French and Spanish Rivieras, Istanbul and Cairo. But local tourism has been on the rise for the last five years, spearheaded by a government campaign to encourage Saudis to spend their vacation dollars at home. \"There are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who suffer when they go abroad,\" said Ibrahim al Sayed, director general of tourism development in the country\u0027s mountainous southwest Asir region. \"They don\u0027t want their teen-agers to copy Westerners.\" He added that many Saudis are also acutely aware that language and cultural barriers make them attractive victims for con artists abroad. \"I\u0027ve traveled in Europe and I\u0027ve faced some of the troubles,\" said Fahd al Sayejh, public relations manager at the Riyadh Intercontinental Hotel. \"My family\u0027s now looking for a villa in Abha (in the cooler Asir region). There are many people who spend their summers there who used to go to Europe. \"It\u0027s beautiful. It reminds us of the old days when we used to go to Lebanon every summer. The mountains are the same,\" he added. \"(But) in the oil boom years, businessmen thought nothing of driving to the airport and boarding any available international flight. Now people are more aware of spending their money.\" Tourism within Saudi Arabia may seem like a hard sell, given the country\u0027s reputation as a \"desert kingdom,\" lacking much in the way of amusement. But beaches along the country\u0027s eastern border on the Persian Gulf draw big crowds. Jidda on the Red Sea attracts scuba-diving enthusiasts and Najran, close to Yemen, offers unusual architecture. For a change of scenery, many tourists try the southwest. \"The whole southwest area is very popular,\" said Antoni Kuhnen, who runs the Al-Baha Motel in that region. Kuhnen estimates that the motel, opened in 1985, now books around 20,000 tourists a year. Al-Baha, Saudi Arabia\u0027s smallest province, is situated between Taif, where the government retreats into the mountains for the summer months, and Abha, capital of Asir province, which boasts 1,736 square miles of national park. A local newspaper noted that \"visitors to the Abha region reached an unprecedented number, to the extent that the real estate offices in Abha cannot cope with the great demand for furnished and unfurnished flats.\" An estimated 800,000 visitors were reported to have made it despite a relatively small airport. The recent popularity of in-country tourism is due largely to the government. Five years ago, the few tourists who came to this region had to either camp out or rely on the kindness of strangers for accommodation. Now, there are five hotels in the area, some of them bankrolled by the Finance Ministry. Private businessmen are also being encouraged to invest in tourism. An amusement park would make the area more attractive to Saudi families who generally have large numbers of children to entertain, he said. Land has already been allocated, but awaits an investor. Al-Baha does not lack scenic beauty. At nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, the air is cool, crisp, and a bit damp -- a welcome change from just about anyplace else in the kingdom during the summer months. The mountains, rough, craggy, and dotted with scrubby green plants, rise dramatically out of the Tihama Valley and are populated by shepherds tending flocks of sheep and goats. Baboons lope down the mountainside, carrying scraps of food fed to them by motel staff and early rising guests. \"As long as the facilities are there, the tourists will come,\" said Kuhnen, who nonetheless believes the region suffers for lack of recreational diversions.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition BRAZIL\u0027S FISHERMEN -- JANGADEIROS -- CLING TO TRADITION AS THEY REAP SEA\u0027S BOUNTY Just before sunset, the fishermen sail into Fortaleza Harbor on their rafts and dump the day\u0027s catch of mackerel, moray eels and red snappers on the sand. People gather around shouting their bids. Fisherman Raminundo Nonato Tavares comes away with 13,000 cruzados (about $13) -- not bad for a day\u0027s work, but nothing like the old times. \"When I was a boy, we\u0027d fish for half the time we do now and catch twice as much,\" said Tavares, who is 40 but whose weather-beaten face looks years older. \"We used to come to port with the boat weighing low in the water from all the fish,\" Tavares said during a recent visit. Tavares is one of thousands of men on Brazil\u0027s northeast coast who for years have been fishing on jangadas, or small wooden rafts, but who now see their livelihood disappearing. Overfishing by big commercial trawlers and a boom in the shrimp trade, which kills tons of fish, have been cutting into their catch and forcing many to seek steadier work on trawlers. About 200 jangadas now sail out of Fortaleza Harbor, where 20 years ago there were about double that number, said Wilson Goncalves, president of the local fishermen\u0027s union in this city of 1.3 million people. Work is risky on a jangada, not much bigger than a double bed and powered only by the wind, and the fishing season lasts only six months a year, as the sea is too stormy in winter. But jangadeiros, as the fishermen are known, cling to tradition. They refuse the usual equipment for commercial fishing like motors, nets and compasses, relying entirely on hook and line and a knowledge passed down from generations of how to find the fish. Most are illiterate and, since their early teens, have never changed their routine of sailing out to sea before dawn and returning before sunset. They bring most of their catch home to their families and sell the rest to tide them over during the winter months. \"The jangadeiro does not understand or want technology. He\u0027s a subsistence fishermen who will rely on custom until the day he dies,\" said Goncalves. Custom has well-served Tavares and other jangadeiros for generations. He can tell by the color of the water which fish will be most plentiful in a certain area. Darker, deeper water suggests the presence of mackerel, grouper and -- if it\u0027s a lucky day -- shark. A green hue often means a coral reef lies below, and that means the moray eel, which will bring Tavares a high price because of its tasty meat and because trawlers using nets rarely snare them. Using the weather, ocean currents and even the phases of the moon as his guides, he says, he can almost always find the kind of fish he is seeking. \"My father taught me most of it, but some of it I had to learn myself. The sea is always changing,\" he said as he cast his line in a place that he thought would yield red snapper, a small, ruddy fish. Within half an hour, he had caught five. But the 20th Century is closing in on the jangadeiros, who bitterly resent the commercial trawlers they say are emptying their waters of fish. \"So many fish in the ocean, and our share is so small after the fishing boats come through,\" said Francisco dos Reis, who often joins Tavares on his craft. \"We used to be able to fill that basket with fish. Now we\u0027re lucky if we can fill it halfway after a whole day at sea,\" Dos Reis said. One reason for the drop in their catch is the boom in Fortaleza\u0027s shrimp industry, which exports heavily to the United States. When shrimp fishermen haul in their nets, they also bring in thousands of fish that have gotten entangled and died. The fishermen throw them overboard because, unlike the shrimp, fish won\u0027t bring in coveted export dollars.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition FORGOTTEN TRIBES OF LEBANON\u0027S WADI KHALED THRIVE ON SMUGGLING OF GOODS TO SYRIA Trapped in this northern Lebanese valley, a forgotten community living by tribal traditions thrives on smuggling goods across the river to Syria. Despite the affluence this has brought, the Bedouins of Wadi Khaled feel as if they are prisoners in their own land, captive because of a historical mishap that left them with no citizenship rights. Their status has been \"under study\" since 1968. More than 50 years ago, the tribes\u0027 fear of officials drove the people to hide in the woods. They missed Lebanon\u0027s only official census, conducted in 1932 when the country was still under French mandate. No population count has been carried out since, so the status of the residents of Wadi Khaled is still pending. Abu Mustapha, clad in traditional Arab headdress and gray gallabia, or ankle-length shirt, said the tribesmen mistook census officials for envoys of the Ottoman Empire authorities. \"They hid in the woods because they were afraid their children would be drafted into the Ottoman army. They were illiterate people and did not understand that we were not under Ottoman rule anymore,\" said Abu Mustapha. The Bedouins of Wadi Khaled hold residence permits, issued to all foreigners living in Lebanon, and a document which classifies them in a \"citizenship under study\" category. Unlike Palestinians and other refugees in Lebanon who have a special travel document, these tribesmen have no passports and can travel almost nowhere. Syria is the only country that allows them inside its borders, just for brief visits. \"We have become prisoners in our own land,\" said Sweid. The people of Wadi Khaled -- named after Khaled Ibn al-Walid, who drove out the Byzantine Christians -- are divided into tribes who trace their origin to what is now Saudi Arabia. Until the 1960s, they raised sheep in the bare rugged hills nearby. Then they turned to trade. \"We are on the border between a socialist country (Syria) and a country that believes in free trade (Lebanon),\" said Bashir Hammoud. Syria has strict import controls and the smuggled traffic across the Nahr el-Bared river into the country includes television sets, radios, videos, fruit, vegetables, canned food, coffee, sugar, building material, clothes and shoes. Wadi Khaled\u0027s marketplace, Al-Arida, is a favorite of Syrian families, with prices given in Syrian pounds that the merchants later change to dollars at the rate of 46 to a dollar. \"We sell here what Syrians can only buy on the black market in their country. Everything they do not have they buy here,\" said Hammoud. The Ghannam tribe, the largest and most influential, boasts that its standard of living is higher than that of many people in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. Most of its members live in spacious cement houses with almost no furniture. They traditionally prefer sitting on the floor. Khaled Sweid, who holds a degree in mathematics, estimated that each family in the Ghannam tribe earned an average of about $200 per month compared to the national minimum wage of $30 per month. The residents of Wadi Khaled, all Sunni Muslims, have pleaded their case with all the governments that have ruled Lebanon since independence in 1943, but to no avail. Christian politicians, who hold key posts in the government, have resisted naturalizing 10,000 Muslims because it could upset the sectarian balance in the country. \"Our plight became the subject of bickering among politicians,\" said a Ghannam tribesman, one of a group squatting in a smoke-filled room and sharing a meal of lamb and rice. \"The solution for us lies with the Lebanese government. But now which one do we turn to?\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition AT $80 PER MUSHROOM, PRICE FOR MATSUTAKE IS HIGH EVEN FOR THE JAPANESE In the land of $7 apples and $6 boxes of granola, matsutake mushrooms are in a class of their own. Japanese drop their usual tones of careful politeness and become positively rapturous in describing these unassuming brown fungi, their woodsy taste and piney smell. The owner of one of the world\u0027s most exclusive restaurants, Kicho, where meals can run $800 a person and only an introduction from a previous customer can win a reservation, recently wrote: \"In autumn we can almost not do our business without matsutake.\" But for the uninitiated, it is the price tag of the matsutake, or pine-tree mushrooms, that is so breathtaking: a few inches high and, in fact, rather mushroom-like in appearance, a single well-shaped matsutake can cost as much as $80; even an average one will run $40 per stem. Matsutake are so pricey and so prized that matsutake fraud has now entered the Japanese lexicon. Recently it was discovered that some of these mushrooms were being sold with tiny lead slivers inserted in their stems to inflate their weight and thus their asking price. Worth It to Japanese For the Japanese, who adore all manner of mushrooms and use about half a dozen different varieties in their everyday food, the price is clearly worth it. \"I love them,\" a Japanese newspaper editor said recently, as he dropped the subject at hand -- stock market manipulation -- to wax eloquent about matsutake. A Japanese folk saying sums up the emotionalism toward matsutake: \"The mountain where you picked matsutake cannot be forgotten.\" With this saying in mind, a farming community troubled by a high rate of bachelorhood among its young men recently held a matsutake-picking party in an effort to entice women back to the farm. According to mushroom connoisseurs, matsutake are expensive because their season is short -- just a few weeks in late fall -- and because they can grow only in the wild. Japan\u0027s wilderness has been disappearing steadily in the face of relentless urbanization, and the red pine trees around which matsutake flourish have also been diminishing. Not Domesticated Yet The finest scientists have failed so far to domesticate the matsutake on a mass scale, despite repeated efforts. Mie Ogoshi of Japan\u0027s Tsuji Cooking School said that matsutake were much more common and much cheaper 20 years ago and were used liberally in the kitchen. Now, however, they are rationed parsimoniously: paper-thin slices in a special broth, a few bits mixed in a rice dish or a few grilled with a touch of lime and soy sauce. One special soup features a little matsutake with a touch of real gold shavings. Demand for matsutake is so strong that the import-resistant Japanese have turned to South Korea and China, where matsutake also grow and cost much less. Mushroom aficionados insist that these imports do not taste as good as local ones; among other drawbacks, to satisfy customs inspectors the matsutake must be washed well, which attenuates their aroma, they say. Nonetheless, every fall, die-hard matsutake lovers figure that it is worth the price of a Tokyo-Seoul round-trip ticket (about $500) to fill a few boxes with fresh Korean matsutake and lovingly carry them home. Still, even in affluent Japan, there are many who find $80 per mushroom a bit rich for the blood. One Japanese woman who raved about the taste and autumnal smell of matsutake admitted, after calming down, that she had not bought one in 15 years. \u0027Like They Are Gold\u0027 \"When you look at the price tag on the matsutake, it is like they are gold,\" acknowledged Ogoshi, of the cooking school. And like many high-priced foods in Japan, including the beautiful cantaloupe grown here and sold, individually wrapped, for $80 or more, matsutake most often are given as presents. For those who love their matsutake but cannot afford them, one enterprising Japanese company recently developed \"essence of matsutake,\" a small vial of which costs only $2.50. The liquid can be poured on top of the lowly shiitake or ma-shu-ru-mu (white American-style mushroom), allowing the diner to imagine it is the real thing.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition WESTERN OFFICIALS LOOK TO AFGHANISTAN AND SEE A NEW PROBLEM -- HEROIN In northeastern Afghanistan, small numbers of returned refugees have been rebuilding their homes and replanting their terraced fields. But not all the fields returned to the plow in the last year have been planted with wheat and corn. Many -- perhaps one out of every two -- were turned over to the cultivation of marijuana and opium-producing poppies. In fact, many Western narcotics control officials, diplomats, some members of the Afghan resistance, and Pakistani officials, are concerned that this region could develop into the world\u0027s leading producer of heroin -- the potent drug derived from opium. The primary source of opium for the West remains Southeast Asia\u0027s \"Golden Triangle\" -- Burma, Laos, and Thailand. But since the mid-1980s, international narcotics control sources say, the \"Golden Crescent\" of Southwest Asia has gained prominence. 30% of Market Together, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran account for at least 30% of the United States heroin market, these sources estimate. Afghanistan, according to narcotics officials, is the region\u0027s largest producer. Last year\u0027s opium crop is estimated at between 500 and 700 tons. The 1988-89 poppy season, which normally begins with the first rains in December, is expected to increase output by 100 to 200 tons. The reasons for Afghanistan\u0027s increased production include: lack of government control in much of the countryside during the nine-year war against Soviet occupation; crackdowns on cultivation in Pakistan, which have made Afghanistan a safer production center; Tehran\u0027s apparent willingness to allow trafficking through Iran; and growing demand in neighboring Pakistan and the West. For many peasants, white-and-pink poppy flowers are the easiest and most lucrative cash crop. Harvesting the sticky, black sap can bring a small farmer up to $2,000 -- a fortune in this area. Dealers take the opium by horse and mule across the border into Pakistan\u0027s tribal border districts; there, scores of illicit laboratories process the opium into heroin. Difficult to Control \"We don\u0027t have to be Adam Smith to realize we have a problem,\" says Carlo Boccia, a representative of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Paris. \"When drugs become more readily available, they become more difficult to control.\" Western narcotics officials say they do not know how much of Iran\u0027s \"tremendous\" poppy production reaches the international market. Pakistan is believed to have produced 200 or more tons of opium last year. Most of the region\u0027s heroin is manufactured in Pakistani labs. (Ten pounds of opium produce about one pound of pure heroin, which can sell for tens of thousands to a few hundred thousand dollars in the West. Heroin sold in the West is diluted, about 5% pure.) One of the most severe effects of this rapidly growing regional trade, Western aid officials and other sources say, is its corrupting and undermining influence on Pakistani and Afghan society. They cite: * A rise in the number of Pakistani addicts, most of whom \"chase the drag-on\" (smoke heroin), from an estimated 200,000 in the early 1980s to between 1 million to 3 million today. * The spread of heroin abuse among Pakistan\u0027s 3 million Afghan refugees. * Corruption that involves senior Pakistan government officials, Army officers, politicians, refugee administrators, businessmen, tribal leaders, and members of the Afghan resistance. This was alleged separately by narcotics and intelligence officials, and Western aid sources. Gang Warfare Feared In addition, there are fears that the \"drug and gun culture\" on both sides of the border could increase gang warfare. \"You have got to understand that it is a huge business in this part of the world. There are terrible things going on, and they involve a lot of people,\" says a worried representative of the Afghan resistance. Pakistan\u0027s new prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, has described illegal drugs as the country\u0027s \"No. 1 problem\" and has created a Ministry of Narcotics to tackle it. Diplomats and aid workers are skeptical about chances for success. \"The only reason we have not yet seen the sort of violence you find in Colombia (South America) is that enough people here are getting paid off to keep the trade going,\" a Western aid official says. \"The moment you start hitting where it hurts, the situation will start getting nasty.\" A Route Through Karachi Narcotics from eastern and northern Afghanistan and Pakistan\u0027s border areas are channeled to Karachi; those from southern Afghanistan go toward Iran. According to aid sources, trucks from the government-run National Logistics Corporation, which normally carry goods to Afghan refugee camps, often take heroin to Karachi. \"There is a lot of direct collaboration with the police, the Army, and the refugee administration,\" says a Western official. For appearances, sources say, a vehicle is sometimes deliberately sacrificed to the police. The rest then proceed unhindered to Karachi, where the heroin is taken by boat or plane to the Mideast and Europe. Berlin an Entry Point Some sources allege that officials in Pakistan\u0027s National Shipping Company are involved. Narcotics officials say East Berlin, a drugs gateway in the 1970s, is once again becoming a major entry point. The production of opium in southwest Afghanistan has come under the control of local drug lords, cooperating closely with Pakistani traffickers as well as drug syndicates from Europe and North America, intelligence sources say. At Musa Qala, a fertile region in southern Afghanistan, poppy growing is largely run by Nassim Akhun Zada, say journalists and relief workers who have visited the area. Zada is a guerrilla commander, reportedly still affiliated with an Afghan resistance party, the Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami, but who operates largely on his own. Western sources say Zada leads a private army of 1,200 fighters. Recently, there have been reports of pitched battles with a rival, Abdul Rahman Khan of the Hizb-i-Islami resistance party. Government Role Seen From Musa Qala, part of the opium harvest is transported to eastern Iran. But most is taken to the Pakistani desert refugee camps at Gerde-Jangal. There, resistance and aid sources say, trafficking is carried out in collaboration with officers of Pakistan\u0027s Interservices Intelligence (ISI) organization. At Gerde-Jangal, the opium is weighed and some is processed by local labs. \"There is so much dealing going on that the money is not counted but weighed,\" a Western aid representative says. Various sources, including a former trafficker from Quetta, say narcotics are driven in five-vehicle convoys -- two carrying drugs, the other three armed guards and heavy machine guns -- through government checkpoints, to Robat. Robat is believed to have 20 or more heroin labs, from which the drug is driven in armed convoys across southern Iran to Turkey and on to Europe and America. Sources say the Robat operations involve members of at least three Afghan resistance parties. It is uncertain whether party officials in Quetta and Peshawar are linked to the trafficking. Foreigners are forbidden to enter Robat \"for security reasons.\" Some sources claim that the aim is to prevent outsiders from witnessing what goes on. \"It is perfectly obvious that this trafficking could not proceed without the full knowledge of the ISI (Interservices Intelligence) and the local Pakistani authorities,\" a West European diplomat says.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition A SAD BUT GROWING PHENOMENON; CHINA COPES WITH ITS UNWANTED BABIES Shen Xiaozhi, a 2-month-old foundling with a growth the size of a grapefruit on her back, is one of the lucky ones. She is being looked after in the well-equiped Beijing Children\u0027s Welfare Institute. But many of the thousands of unwanted babies being left in big cities in railway stations, outside hospitals, on docksides and even tossed on rubbish heaps cannot expect to survive. It is a phenomenon that has grown steadily in recent years, partly as a result of the one-child policy but also because as social controls have loosened, China\u0027s rural population has become more mobile. The temptation for Chinese peasants to abandon their physically handicapped babies in big cities where there is at least a chance of getting the right medical care and treatment is inevitable. Notes, Money Attached \"Many of the babies are found with money or notes attached to them but never with the parents\u0027 address,\" said Ye Tieliang, director of the Beijing Children Welfare Institute, the city\u0027s only state-run orphanage. According to the People\u0027s Daily, about 50 foundlings are left at Beijing\u0027s capacious and overcrowded railway station each year and similar numbers are left at other major stations. Between 1986 and 1987, nearly 700 foundlings were picked up in Canton city while an investigation in five of the province\u0027s counties showed that 862 babies were picked up. The babies are frequently female or suffering from Down\u0027s Syndrome, broken backs, deafness, blindness -- or even such easily cured defects as harelips. \u0027Many Never Survive\u0027 Unofficial sources claimed, however, that the problem is far greater than is being admitted with thousands of children being left in Beijing alone. \"Most of them never survive. They are usually too weak and they are an unwanted burden,\" the sources said. Earlier this year the legal newspapers said that in 15 months, 25 vagrants had been found dead at Beijing\u0027s railway station. The issue is highly sensitive and public security officials, who are responsible for handling the unwanted babies, declined to be interviewed. Ye denied a People\u0027s Daily report that his institute received 141 handicapped foundlings last year. However, the Beijing municipal authorities have issued a circular warning people they will face prosecution if they abandon a child, an act that contravenes the constitution. Rewards Offered Rewards are being offered to people who help locate parents of the foundlings. Only 1.8% of the country\u0027s 10 million disabled children receive special care in child welfare institutions set up in the country\u0027s urban areas. Nationwide, there are 60 state-run child-welfare institutions that can provide reasonable service on a long-term basis to 11,000 disabled children in urban areas. The Beijing Institute appears to serve primarily handicapped children in return for financial donations. At the Tianjin children\u0027s welfare institute, officials say that what was originally designed for orphans has become \"an abandoned babies\" collecting house. \"The cruel-hearted parents threw out their babies who were handicapped but they had money to buy refrigerators and color TV sets, so why didn\u0027t they send these children to hospital?\" an official at Tianjin was quoted by the People\u0027s Daily. Few of the orphans are adopted and the Tianjin children\u0027s institute says it can no longer afford to pay for so many children\u0027s medical fees.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition PRIEST\u0027S OUSTER SILENCES HAITI\u0027S VOICE OF THE POOR The expulsion of a radical slum priest from his ecclesiastic order has silenced Haiti\u0027s most influential voice for the rights of the nation\u0027s poor. In expelling Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the conservative Salesian Order accused the populist Roman Catholic cleric of fomenting class warfare, calling him a \"protagonist of destabilization.\" His ouster was announced Dec. 15 in a statement from Rome. Although Aristide remains a priest, he cannot officiate at Mass or deliver sermons over church radio. \"He has been neutralized,\" said sociologist Franklyn Midi. Outspoken Campaigner Aristide, 35, a Salesian priest since 1975, has been one of the most outspoken campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for nearly its entire 184-year existence by dictators. He has escaped at least three attempts on his life, including a Sept. 11 attack at his St. Jean Bosco Church in a Port-au-Prince slum in which thugs armed with machetes, guns, clubs and spears killed 12 people and wounded at least 70 others. One week later, rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a coup that put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power. Coup leaders said they wanted democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence, citing the church massacre as an example. Salesian officials expelled Aristide after he failed to obey their order to leave Haiti by Oct. 17 and assume a new post in Canada. Popular Protests Two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular protests. Thousands protested in support of Aristide for several days in October, but there were no immediate demonstrations after the expulsion. Aristide, who has been seen in public only once since the church massacre, has made no public statement and has declined requests for interviews. But friends say his morale is excellent and he might appeal the church decision. Despite its condemnation of military brutality and human-rights abuses in Haiti, the Catholic hierarchy has long opposed Aristide\u0027s political proselytizing of the poor. A proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church involvement in a political struggle by the poor against social injustice, Aristide preaches \"active nonviolence.\" He urges a \"real revolution\" to bring democracy to Haiti, but does not specifically propose an armed uprising. Fire and Brimstone His pulpit style is that of a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose leading questions prompt quick responses from the congregation. The sermons were broadcast nationwide and earned Aristide a huge following among the urban poor and the rural peasantry, who call the bespectacled ascetic their \"prophet.\" Although civic leaders and many priests applauded Aristide\u0027s crusade, the church hierarchy apparently feared the possible consequences of radicalizing the masses. \"The upper and middle classes, of course, have heaved a sigh of relief,\" Midi said of Aristide\u0027s ouster. \"They are uncomfortable when the voice of the poor is raised too high.\" \"What they have not understood is that Aristide has contained the resentment of the impoverished masses by giving it a religious form,\" Midi added. \"He has not sent them into the streets but drawn them into the church.\" Bishops Were Worried A Salesian spokesman in Rome, Father Joseph Aubrey, told the Voice of America that the expulsion was ordered because Haitian \"bishops worried about the results of Aristide\u0027s action.\" But Father Serge Miot, secretary of Haitian Bishops Council, denied that the council had asked the Salesians to expel Aristide. The effective silencing of Aristide coincides with a move by Avril to tighten army discipline after a purported Oct. 14 coup attempt. Since then, the government has imprisoned or discharged dozens of soldiers for alleged insubordination. Leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down on the most progressive element in the army -- soldiers angered by the slow progress in bringing about the democratic reforms Avril promised when he became president. Had Become a Symbol It is not known what role, if any, the government had in Aristide\u0027s ouster; but to some, the priest has become a symbol of the democratic struggle. \"Aristide was discharged from his religious order in the same way that soldiers faithful to the Sept. 17 reform movement have been discharged from the army,\" said Paul Dejean, a Haitian author and social worker, referring to those who participated in the coup to gain democratic reforms. \"People who believe in the Gospel values of liberation, liberty and justice are penalized and punished,\" he said.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition \u0027DOUBLE STANDARD\u0027 RAISES EYEBROWS IN SHIAS\u0027 CAPITAL The scantily dressed dancers are long gone. The last liquor store was blown up six years ago. This ancient Roman city now is the Lebanese capital of Shia Muslim fundamentalism. Public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief male-female unions called \"pleasure marriages\" are condoned. On the surface at least, life in Baalbek is governed by the dictates of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u0027s stern brand of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, which to Western eyes appears joyless and forbidding. Wearing makeup or jewelry in public is taboo. So is singing and dancing at mixed gatherings because, as one woman noted, \"it causes psychological imbalance and tempts men.\" But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black robe-like chadors Shia women have to wear in public are discarded in favor of shorts and strapless tops, along with makeup and perfume. \"People think we\u0027re made of stone just because we cover ourselves with chadors. But we\u0027re not. We\u0027re ready to do anything to please our husbands,\" said Selma, a housewife. Before Lebanon\u0027s civil war erupted in 1975, Baalbek was a cultural center where dance and theatrical festivals were held in the breathtaking Roman amphitheaters. Now the ruins echo with Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists stage political rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of \"Death to America! Death to Israel!\" The amphitheaters have also been used as mortar positions in Lebanon\u0027s sectarian fighting. The Shias\u0027 strict life style has drawn bitter criticism from many Lebanese, Muslims and Christians alike who say that the fundamentalists\u0027 \"double standards\" have brought Islam into disrepute. Most Shias in Baalbek belong to Hezbollah (Party of God), which is believed to be an umbrella for Shia kidnapers holding most of the 16 foreigners missing in Lebanon. It\u0027s made up of zealots blindly loyal to Khomeini. \"We follow whatever Khomeini decrees. Whatever he rejects, we reject,\" said Zeinab Nasser, an administrator at the women\u0027s \"haouzeh,\" or religious center, in Baalbek. The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs frowned on by other Lebanese, especially moderate Shias and Sunnis. In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a curl of her hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited number of lovers in the name of religion. But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are considered respectable and far from promiscuous. The practice is widespread in Iran, where the overwhelming majority of the 54 million population is Shia. Nasser said the Prophet Mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage, making it acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period that could last \"for an hour, two days, a month or as long as they desire.\" \"It\u0027s all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child born after the marriage contract expires,\" she explained. She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid Lebanon\u0027s economic crisis because \"men cannot afford a regular marriage, and let\u0027s face it, they have physical needs. \"If these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure marriage provides the outlet,\" she added. \"It\u0027s much better than doing it illicitly.\" No cleric is required to perform the ceremony. The woman, who should preferably be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, \"I give myself to you in pleasure.\" He responds: \"I accept.\" And that\u0027s it. Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not seek it. As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit classical music \"because it does not have any negative psychological effects,\" Nasser said. She observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is bad for \"the nerves and the blood circulation.\" Like other factions in Lebanon, where the government has collapsed, the Shias have established their own medical and welfare systems, amply funded by Iran. Abbas Mousavi, a Hezbollah leader, said: \"Social work has become one of our main responsibilities because of the catastrophes that have befallen Lebanon. \"We\u0027ve founded the Imam Khomeini Hospital here, which provides free medical treatment. There are similar centers in other Shia areas.\" He noted: \"We\u0027ve also founded pharmacies that make a very small profit, as well as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000 students in the near future. \"We\u0027ve given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills to provide wells in remote villages, especially those we consider to have military or political importance.\" Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and nightclubs, Mousavi noted: \"We\u0027re not imposing Islamic values on people. No one can say we\u0027ve raided houses where people gamble or drink.\" Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded: \"There were incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal after witnessing aberrant behavior. But Hezbollah is against that.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition OVERNIGHT MILLIONAIRES; COLOMBIA\u0027S EMERALD MINES: GREEN GOLD About 150 miles from Bogota lie the mines of Muzo and Coscuez, the biggest emerald deposits in the world. The car drive from the Colombian capital over a potholed track takes eight to 10 hours. To Santa Barbara, a small town 5 miles from the mining centers, the land is a lush green. Thereafter, the terrain is a gray bleakness. The wild mountain peaks are covered from morning until evening in a cloak of mist as if nature seeks to hide its treasures. The houses in Santa Barbara are made of wood, despite the millions of pesos to be made in the town every day. There are no hotels, not even hostels for the simple traveler. Yet the finest and most expensive Scotch flows, and fortunes are squandered in the town\u0027s bars and dives. The neighboring town of Muzo usually has about 5,000 residents, but during an emerald boom -- and that happens whenever a new seam is discovered -- the population soars to 20,000. Warnings Issued For those unacquainted with the land, the journey into the mining zone can be extremely dangerous. Tourists are warned to stay away. The area has been dubbed the \"Land of 1,001 Nights\" and the \"Devil\u0027s Caldron.\" Wild rags-to-riches stories go the rounds in Muzo and Coscuez, where millionaires have been made overnight. Thousands of adventurers have lost their lives in bloody fighting among themselves. Numerous crosses planted by the roadside or dotting the fields are silent testimony to the violence. The emerald is a form of beryl, a mineral found principally in granite and granite pegmatites. It is prospected in its pure form as a precious stone and is green or blue-green in color. \"The most valuable are the so-called \u0027oil drops\u0027 and \u0027water eyes,\u0027 veritable masterpieces of nature for which vast sums are paid,\" explained a jeweler in Bogota. The precious stones prospected in Muzo and Coscuez are sent to Bogota to be valued by experts. Shine, purity and color determine the price. Emerald mines can also be found in Brazil, Africa, Australia, India and the Soviet Union. Japan even produces synthetic emeralds. State Owns Resources The deposits in Colombia were mined in pre-Columbian times. The present official prospector, the Compania Esmeraldas de Colombia, holds the concession from the state, which owns all mineral resources in the country. The question of how much emerald is actually found in Colombia each year is difficult to answer, as great quantities of the precious stone disappear onto the black market. Official figures put the annual legal export of emeralds at $36.3 million. However, insiders reckon that between $100 million and $150 million worth of Colombian emeralds are marketed each year. The price of the stone depends on many factors, including ever-changing supply and demand, and the fluctuating rate of the dollar. Prospective purchasers are advised not to buy from strangers in the street, but to go to a respected jeweler. Distinguishing a fake from the real thing is not an easy task, even for the experts. Many a traveler has returned home with worthless glass instead of a valuable gem.",

It turned out to be a woman who died of exposure while trying to break into her home. The body of Sherry Gaydos, 34, clad only in her underwear and socks, was found Wednesday by the neighbor, hanging upside down with her left leg wedged in a pantry window at her home. Gaydos\u0027 husband, John, was asleep inside the house when the incident occurred, unaware of his wife\u0027s struggle for life, police said. \"It took two policemen to pry the window off her foot,\" John Gaydos said. \"She hung upside down by her ankle and froze to death.\" Gaydos said his wife left home while he slept Tuesday evening and drove the car to the end of the alley, where the vehicle struck a telephone pole. Sherry Gaydos was taken unconscious to a Dayton hospital for treatment, then was released or left on her own, her husband said. In the meantime, her car -- with the keys inside -- was towed out of the alley, he said. Police told Gaydos that their investigation showed that his wife took a cab from the hospital to their home around 1 a.m. Wednesday. With her keys gone, Sherry Gaydos apparently tried to force her way into a pantry window at the rear of the building and became trapped after the window closed on her foot, her husband said. Gaydos said his wife apparently had removed some of her clothes \"because she was trying to be thin enough to get through the small window.\" \"It was very small. No human could really have gotten into it,\" he said. It appeared Sherry Gaydos tried to boost herself through the window using a metal garbage can. The can was tipped over beneath the window. Wilma Johnson, the neighbor who discovered the woman\u0027s snow-covered body, said she noticed the body hanging from the window about 9 a.m. Wednesday but thought it was a department store mannequin. When it still was there several hours later, she investigated. Gaydos said he was at home while his wife was trying to enter the house, having fallen asleep on the couch. He said he awoke at about 11:30 and went to bed but was not aware that his wife had left. Dave Lett, an investigator with the Montgomery County coroner\u0027s office, said the official cause of death was not determined pending toxicology tests. \"With this type of death, a woman hanging out of the window by one leg in her underclothing in severe weather, you question that kind of death,\" Lett said. \"But at this point we did not find any foul play.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition ERITREAN REBEL CAMPAIGN BACKED BY HIDDEN FACTORIES, ETHIOPIAN POWS It is 11 p.m. White-coated technicians shuffle in surgical clogs from tubes to beakers, inspecting the quality of anti-tuberculosis pills rattling out of a molding machine at a rate of 40,000 per hour. This isn\u0027t the late shift. It is the only shift at \"EPLF Pharmaceuticals,\" a lab housed inside four giant shipping crates 300 miles from the nearest independent electricity supply. Outside in a remote valley in Eritrea in northern Ethiopia, crickets and frogs join buzzing mosquitoes and the noise of foxes chasing African hares over the boulders. Civet cats and gray owls watch from stunted, moonlit trees. Inside, technicians of the Eritrean People\u0027s Liberation Front produce no less than 37 varieties of pills, capsules, ointments and liquids to be packed into brown bottles marked \"EPLF Drug Production and Research\" over a logo of a cobra wrapped round a pharmacist\u0027s pestle. The 5-year-old drug venture is just one of many backup industries supporting the EPLF\u0027s 27-year-old guerrilla war for independence from Ethiopia. They produce souped-up automobile engines, machine tools, truck bodies, molded shoes, textbooks, pamphlets, flour-milling machines, macaroni, spaghetti and even sanitary towels. Safety of Darkness Like the watch and electrical repair shops and the tank and truck garages, they are heavily camouflaged and operate under the safety of darkness, free of the threat of bombardment from Ethiopian MIG warplanes. All are staffed by trained personnel, many graduates, working without salary as their contribution to the massive, centralized war effort. The pharmaceutical factory is the centerpiece of the key EPLF doctrine of self-reliance and self-sufficiency, forced on it by years of isolation from external support. Basic chemicals are imported from Europe to make a range of the most frequently used preparations against diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. The EPLF factories produce about 40% of the basic list of 187 EPLF-approved drugs covering tetracycline antibiotics, sulfanilamides, vitamins, iron supplements, anti-parasitic, paracetamol and aspirin compounds. Even limited current production is reckoned to be worth more than $750,000 a year -- $310,000 in sterile solutions for drips and major surgery alone. More Shipping Containers Plans are afoot to boost capacity -- with the aid of more shipping containers and plentiful mud -- to 80% of total drug needs. The laboratory and its integrated research department, run by an Eritrean pharmacist trained in Ethiopia and the United States, is hidden conveniently close to the EPLF\u0027s main hospital at Arota in northern Eritrea. The hospital is a huge complex, able to treat 800 to 1,000 patients in small units dug into rock, camouflaged and spaced for safety along 5 miles of narrow valley. It links a network of provincial hospitals, civilian clinics and medic stations concealed near the battle fronts. About 99% of EPLF, civilian and Ethiopian prisoner casualties can be treated for almost every kind of ailment and wound in this health system. Neighboring valleys hold mechanical and electrical shops equipped with lathes and specialist machinery to service and substitute even the heaviest industrial plant for both civilian and military needs. That includes giant generating units to supply basic power. Italian Moulding Machine Footwear was a headache until Eritreans working abroad donated an Italian PVC injection molding machine eight years ago. It now cranks out 100 hot pairs of black plastic sandals an hour. The plastic base granules are imported but -- saving a penny as ever -- 20% of the plastic input is recycled from machine waste and old sandals collected from fighters in the field. Black was not a color chosen on considerations of fashion. \"White wouldn\u0027t do for camouflage reasons,\" said a sandal worker. \"Black is the most convenient in that respect.\" Italian colonists who founded an Eritrean state in the late 19th Century left little transport infrastructure. Most major Eritrean towns are connected by poor dirt roads, but these are largely off limits to Eritrean supply convoys because of possible land mines and the threat from Ethiopian warplanes. Movements of huge amounts of munitions and tons of gasoline required alternative networks. In physical terms, this was probably the greatest challenge and is the greatest concrete achievement of the Eritrean liberation movement. Hostile, Rocky Landscapes Hundreds of miles of tracks capable of taking large trailer trucks have been driven through hostile, rocky landscapes. Most are hidden in dry, winding river beds, but shortcuts have been driven over 6,000-foot mountains with hairpin turns that would dizzy a Swiss. \"In the early days we cut those passes with sweat, shovels and picks,\" said a veteran fighter. \"These days, it\u0027s a bit different.\" The rebels now have bulldozers, grading machines and blasting powder, supplemented by the combined muscle of some 12,000 Ethiopian prisoners of war. Like the stiff-lipped Britons of the \"Bridge over the River Kwai\" movie, they appear to take a perverse pride in their contribution to the Eritrean revolt. Garages dot the supply routes. They have vulcanizing units, welding and brazing tackle, compressors and machine lathes capable of turning out replacement pistons and rings with critical tolerances. Some specialize like Western car dealers in particular models such as Toyota Landcruisers, olive green four-wheel-drive Moskovitches or monolithic Soviet trucks designed to haul outsize field guns on tires 2 feet thick. Chipped Coke Bottles The parsimonious efficiency of the EPLF backup operation, in which precious little is thrown away, defies cataloguing. Scraps of waste bread piled on sheets outside every field kitchen are not for the birds -- dried, they form the must and yeast for fermentation of a heady wheat beer served in chipped Coke bottles. In the ruined central Eritrean town of Nacfa, flattened by 10 years of almost daily bombing and now a gaunt symbol of the resistance, a 133-millimeter shell case hung on a string with a stick on a tumbledown wall is a makeshift alarm bell. Like swords turned into plowshares, finned back sections of huge unexploded bombs form mountings for drills and metal cutters. Rocket casings become charcoal grills and cooking knives. Door jambs, window frames, bunker roofing and furniture invariably are fashioned from wooden ammunition boxes. Donated burlap grain sacks are transformed into curtains and rugs, sun awnings, roof insulation and false ceilings. USAID sacks are particularly popular. They are often made from a close-woven, almost waterproof plastic and make warm mattresses. At the swarming Ethiopian POW camps, bored but grateful inmates fritter away hot hours around noon with playing cards cut from pasteboard ammunition packing. As the sun cools they stir and, helped enthusiastically by rebel guards as sick as their charges with a monotonous dry diet devoid of anything fresh or green, they tend cabbage, capsicum, courgette and spinach developed on EPLF agricultural research stations. The golden revolutionary rule is that nothing comes on a plate. The Eritreans have no alternative to self-reliance.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition FROM CUCUMBERS TO CAVIAR; DEPARTMENT STORE EATERIES HAVE GONE TRENDY TO ATTRACT BUSY SHOPPERS. When caterer David Zafferelli joined the throngs at Nordstrom\u0027s new downtown San Francisco store in October, he dropped $150 on two flannel shirts and another $150 for bubbly and Beluga caviar at the store\u0027s Champagne Exchange bar. \"We just thought that was as much fun as shopping,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll always go for any excuse to drink champagne and eat caviar.\" Increasingly, shoppers who stop to nosh at department stores are finding chic, newfangled eateries in place of the proper tearooms and restaurants of their childhoods. Whereas patrons in the early part of the century sipped tea and nibbled cucumber sandwiches, customers of upscale department stores today are more likely to have espresso and cookies or Cornish game hen and Chardonnay or mesquite-grilled chicken and pasta salad. The shifts in department store food service reflect a fundamental change in the philosophy of shoppers, observers say. In the old days, people would make shopping an all-day event, with a leisurely lunch or tea break built in. Today, with time-starved but hard-working baby boomers hankering for service and quality, the right restaurant can serve not only as a lure but also as an incentive to linger in the store. And shoppers such as Zafferelli have proved willing to spend liberally for the ambiance. Of course, old-fashioned tearooms still exist, and some, such as those at Bullocks Wilshire and Bullock\u0027s Pasadena, are thriving, particularly at holiday time. But many stores in recent years have turned these genteel anachronisms into stylish cafes or bistros where customers come year-round just to dine, never mind the shopping. \"The \u002780s has brought us into a whole different era,\" said Robert J. Nyman, president of George Lang Corp., a New York firm that develops restaurant concepts. \"Most stores today are using food service as an amenity that has to do with the total marketing of the store.\" With department stores undergoing sweeping changes of late, many retailers, particularly downtown merchants that must compete with ubiquitous suburban malls, have strived to hold onto or devise unique operations that make them a destination. Restaurants often fill the bill, even if they don\u0027t contribute heartily to the bottom line. At the new Nordstrom in San Francisco, for example, the marble-topped champagne bar has become a draw for upscale customers, as has an authentic English pub modeled on one at Harrods in London. At the flagship Bloomingdale\u0027s in Manhattan, the premier dining spot among half a dozen eateries is Le Train Bleu, a re-creation of a luxury Orient Express-type dining car. The Dayton Hudson department stores in the Midwest are expanding a Marketplace Foods concept that offers carry-out pasta, stir-fried dishes, freshly baked breads and frozen yogurt to busy downtown workers. Unlike their tearoom predecessors, which usually were situated in a store\u0027s highest reaches, these food outlets are often stashed next to fashion departments. And they are a far cry from the Formica-topped counters prevalent at five-and-dime and discount stores. \"The opportunities for food in department stores are the best they\u0027ve been in over 20 years,\" said John D. Lovelace, central director of food services for Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis. \"People eat every day, but they don\u0027t shop every day.\" Food service has gone in and out of favor with retailers over the last few decades, and even today retailers\u0027 philosophies differ widely. \"It is a very mixed bag,\" said Charles J. Leven, senior vice president, director of operations at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. \"Some companies are cutting back, a few are expanding.\" Saks intends to open its first restaurant at the flagship Manhattan store next year, Leven said, after customers clamored for food service. \u0027Quick Food\u0027 Concepts Until about 1950, large department stores catering to the carriage trade typically used a chunk of their space for tearooms. In the 1960s, the popularity of such rooms declined, and many started losing money. As real estate became more valuable in the 1970s, merchants began devoting the space to clothing and other items that were more profitable. At the same time, many stores were going into suburban malls that had abundant sit-down restaurants or fast-food outlets in so-called food courts. Then women went to work in record numbers and the population became more health and diet conscious. Fewer people had the time or inclination to spend a leisurely afternoon at their favorite tearoom. That gave rise to a variety of \"quick food\" concepts in stores catering to customers for whom money was less of an object than convenience and quality. Nordstrom plunged into the food business 10 years ago after having leased space for years to a small chain of restaurants. It now has 70 food outlets in 58 stores, most under the names Espresso Bar and Cafe Express, featuring fresh soups and salads. Faced with having to attract shoppers to a seedy location three blocks from Union Square in San Francisco, Nordstrom decided to go in for some culinary theatrics in its newest store. \"We wanted to create little pockets of fun,\" said Jim Dickinson, general manager of the Seattle-based chain\u0027s restaurant division. \"We also wanted to create a reason for people to stay in our stores rather than get out to our competitors.\" The Pub, strategically placed next to the men\u0027s department, is modeled on the Green Man at Harrods in London, an innovative retailer that houses about 20 food outlets and a massive food hall where Londoners and tourists alike buy pricey groceries. The Nordstrom room features stools covered with forest green leather, a plank floor made of Kentucky barn wood, a healthy selection of imported and domestic beers and television monitors. If the Pub idea proves successful, Dickinson said, Nordstrom plans to expand it into other new stores nationwide. The chain also is considering a \"bread basket concept\" that would sell freshly baked goods and small open-face sandwiches, already dubbed Nordwiches. The store\u0027s Champagne Exchange was designed to offer a high return. It takes up less space by far than would a traditional tearoom yet affords a high markup on its caviar and 103 champagne varieties. The concept \"enables the customer to spend a lot of money,\" Dickinson said. \"We do find, particularly in San Francisco, it doesn\u0027t bother people to be drinking a $9 glass of champagne.\" Lots of Flash The chain also this holiday rolled out its Nordstrom Select Pantry, a selection of gift food items developed in its restaurants. Overall, Dickinson said, Nordstrom\u0027s restaurant operations account for 1.5% of the chain\u0027s annual sales (which last year totaled nearly $2 billion) yet 22% of its transactions, indicating that food tabs are generally far lower than those for other purchases. Bloomingdale\u0027s flagship store in New York also goes in for selling sizzle along with its steaks. \"The restaurants at Bloomingdale\u0027s have evolved into unique concepts in tune with the eating public,\" said Will Hellemeyer, director of food service. \"We are what people expect of restaurants in the \u002780s . . . and not what they expect to find in a department store restaurant.\" After renovating the housewares department several years ago, the store was left with a long, narrow space on an intermediate level between two floors. A store designer came up with the idea of copying a luxury dining car, complete with green velvet chairs, white linen tablecloths and brass chandeliers. Le Train Bleu (named for a midnight blue engine), which opened in 1978, is \"a Continental restaurant that competes with restaurants on the East Side of Manhattan and is rated in dining guides,\" Hellemeyer said. With seating for 64, the restaurant features such specialties as calf\u0027s liver with cassis and shallots, grilled Cornish game hen stuffed with foie gras and wild rice and grilled swordfish with sun-dried tomato butter. Average tab: $20. Among other Bloomie\u0027s food service operations, Hellemeyer said, are Forty Carrots, a \"healthy food\" restaurant in which the store years ago introduced frozen yogurt to the New York market; Showtime Cafe, an upscale cafeteria similar to Cafe Casino, and Espresso Bar, \"a Euro-chic Italian cafe\" offering desserts, fresh pastas, salads and wines. The decision whether to offer food service is usually based on a store\u0027s location and bottom line. Store officials would not talk about their restaurants\u0027 financial results, but they acknowledged that food service is an expensive proposition. The food business \"in general has lower margins than most other merchandise in a department store,\" said Ken Stevens, a consultant with the Los Angeles office of McKinsey \u0026 Co. It comes down to a trade-off, with the retailer determining whether the intangible benefits of offering the service outweigh the reduced profitability. At Marshall Field\u0027s in Chicago, for instance, the legendary Walnut Room -- a restaurant in the old tradition -- is not considered a big profit maker \"other than that it\u0027s a big draw,\" said Homer G. Sharp, head of central display. \"Obviously, people go shopping while they\u0027re here.\" Some End Food Service With a typical sit-down eatery costing between $500,000 and $1 million to install, many retailers, May Co. California among them, are inclined to put restaurants into free-standing stores but not into those mall locations served by a food court. Another consideration is space: New department stores tend to be far smaller than the huge stores of years past and have less space to spare for low-return businesses. Bonwit Teller, a fashion specialty store, has phased out its food business. Until its purchase by May Department Stores two years ago, Robinson\u0027s was making a big push into food service. Now, it has only three food outlets chain-wide, all of them leased. In designing its newest stores, including those in Los Angeles and Palm Desert, Bullock\u0027s left out restaurants. And when the chain remodeled its Santa Ana location, the restaurant was removed. The tearoom in Bullock\u0027s Pasadena, according to James B. Brooks, the store\u0027s general manager, is the chain\u0027s most profitable food service operation and lately has been expanding its successful banquet business. Even so, the tearoom recently eliminated its evening food service, primarily because of increased restaurant competition in Pasadena. One of the biggest proponents of food is Dayton Hudson Department Store Co., which claims to have the largest upscale food service among U.S. department stores, serving 12 million patrons a year. When Lovelace, the food service director, joined the company in 1982, he immediately set about developing new \"upscale fast-food\" concepts and transforming the company\u0027s traditional sit-down restaurants \"to meet the needs of the customer of the \u002780s.\" Among other operations, the company came up with Yogurt Express, which generates a hefty $1,000 in sales per square foot (compared to about $200 for non-food merchandise) and is being rolled out to several of the company\u0027s 37 stores; 700 Express, designed to serve customers quality fast food within 10 minutes, and a combination of five quick food concepts that replaced the flagship Minneapolis store\u0027s traditional Sky Room and quickly tripled sales. The company is also expanding its 4-year-old Marketplace Foods, similar to Macy\u0027s Cellar in New York, with a substantial carry-out area. Reflecting customers\u0027 rapidly changing palates, ethnic foods are playing a bigger role in Dayton Hudson\u0027s offerings. Forget the cling peach halves, cottage cheese and iceberg lettuce leaves of yore. New menus offer Morocco salad, made with boneless chicken breast and couscous ($6), and smoked salmon with radicchio, bibb lettuce, avocado, grapefruit, chopped egg and caviar, Dayton Hudson\u0027s most expensive salad at $7. The Broadway, too, has found that its customers\u0027 changing tastes have forced it to adapt quickly to new trends. It recently closed a traditional sit-down restaurant at its Brea Mall store in favor of a deli service with lighter fare. \"We . . . have seen a really remarkable response,\" said Richard F. Clayton, president. \u0027Food Is Fashion\u0027 Unlike Bullock\u0027s, the Broadway has put food service operations into its newest stores, but it also recently closed restaurants in Beverly Center and Baldwin Hills where it \"couldn\u0027t come up with a formula that worked,\" Clayton said. The 43-store chain now operates 24 food facilities, serving more than 2 million diners a year. \"That\u0027s a lot of transactions,\" Clayton said. \"It\u0027s important because we touch a lot of customers.\" Meanwhile, food service, once the province of large department stores, has also spread to smaller specialty apparel boutiques such as Koala Blue, with its Australian-style milk bars; Fred Segal, which has restaurants at stores in Santa Monica and on Melrose Avenue; Merry Go Round, a chain selling young men\u0027s and women\u0027s apparel that is testing a \u002750s-style diner and soda fountain in a store in Denver, and Barneys, an exclusive women\u0027s clothier in Manhattan that has Le Cafe, a buffet and bistro bar with about 90 seats. To Dickinson of Nordstrom, the merging of menus and merchandise makes sense. \"We consider ourselves a fashion retail store, and we believe food is fashion,\" he said. \"There is tremendous opportunity for good dining.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition IN SEARCH OF AN IDENTITY; AREA LACKS A SENSE OF COMMUNITY Dick Haddon\u0027s church has an identity problem. \"I tell people that the First United Methodist Church of Gardena is not in Gardena,\" the Rev. Haddon said, \"and people just kind of stare in disbelief. \"This is Gardena, but it\u0027s not. Even the post office says \u0027Gardena,\u0027 but the reality is, we do not live in Gardena. . . . If we had a fire . . . the response would come from the city of Los Angeles.\" That is a complicated fact of life in Harbor Gateway, the 8-mile long, 4-block-wide umbilical cord acquired at the turn of the century to link Los Angeles to its port. In a city where community names conjure up images -- Venice, Silver Lake, Boyle Heights -- Harbor Gateway draws a blank. Bounded on the west by Gardena and Torrance and on the east by Carson and unincorporated county land, the area was for decades known as the \"city strip,\" the \"shoestring strip\" or, simply, \"the strip.\" Area Rechristened Four years ago, the Los Angeles City Council rechristened the area to try to bring a sense of identity and community pride to its citizens -- some of whom do not even know they live in Los Angeles. Harbor Gateway lacks much of what makes a community a community -- no central business district, no civic center or gathering place, no library branch, no police station and, as Haddon noted, no post office. Its largest park is a cemetery. And, despite the new name, mailing addresses of residents remain unchanged. They still say Torrance or Gardena, not Los Angeles. Not surprisingly, this leaves some people confused. \"They say, \u0027Look, my mailing address is Gardena,\u0027 \" reported Gene Painter, the city of Gardena\u0027s superintendent of human services who said he does not turn away Harbor Gateway residents who ask for help. \"Strange as it may seem, they don\u0027t know where they live.\" Optician Chris Toughill joined the Torrance Chamber of Commerce when he opened his shop in a Harbor Gateway strip mall, and his neighbors did the same. It wasn\u0027t until the Torrance mayor declined to attend their grand opening, Toughill said, that the merchants discovered that they were in Los Angeles. Even the young toughs of the Gardena 13 gang, interviewed while hanging out on a Harbor Gateway street corner, insisted they were standing in Gardena. In population, Harbor Gateway is tied with Westwood as Los Angeles\u0027 second-fastest growing area. Sylmar is first. Between 1980 and 1986, according to Los Angeles Planning Department estimates, Harbor Gateway\u0027s population increased 15.6%, from 30,238 to 34,951. A drive through the Gateway is like a trip from the city to the suburbs. On the north end, which begins at El Segundo Boulevard, there are apartments needing repair, gang graffiti on walls and single-family homes with barred windows. The southern end -- which stops at Sepulveda Boulevard, where Harbor City begins -- is punctuated by newly built strip malls, condominiums and well-manicured lawns. Property values follow a similar pattern, with the lowest prices in the north. Home values in nearby Torrance or Gardena, however, are considerably higher. Real estate agents report that a house in Harbor Gateway might sell for as much as $50,000 less than one across the street in another community. Agents attribute the difference to better city services, particularly in Torrance, which has its own schools. \"The minute you mention Los Angeles,\" said Gardena real estate agent John Warner, \"it frightens . . . people away. It\u0027s just one of those things. Homes have always been cheaper over there (Harbor Gateway).\" Said resident Betty Roy: \"I hate to be known to live in the strip. When my friends ask where I live, I tell them Torrance.\" Indeed, four years after the name change -- in spite of spiffy blue-and-white signs that declare \"Harbor Gateway\" below the Los Angeles city seal -- those who live and work there say they still feel betwixt and between, not fully a part of Los Angeles, Harbor Gateway or the bordering cities. \u0027In Limbo\u0027 Moreover, they complain that their new moniker has not brought with it what they really want: more attention from city officials, better services such as street cleaning and tree trimming and, above all, increased police protection. \"We\u0027re like in limbo,\" said Roy, a longtime resident of the Gateway\u0027s southern end. \"We\u0027re not really Torrance and we\u0027re not really Carson. . . . We\u0027re only here because Los Angeles needs this little piece of land to attach to the harbor. Nobody cares about us. . . . We\u0027re like the forgotten people.\" For Sylvia Figueroa, life on the border means a daily struggle at It\u0027s a Miracle, the Mexican pizza parlor she opened a year ago at Gardena Boulevard and Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles. The city of Gardena is across the street, and the differences are stark. On the Gardena side, Gardena Boulevard -- that city\u0027s main business thoroughfare -- is getting a face lift. The street is clean, and the trees are neatly trimmed. City officials are offering grants to business owners for renovations. Neighborhood Contrasts Across the street in Los Angeles, the trees are scraggly and overgrown, vagrants sleep in a littered vacant lot, liquor stores abound and the Gardena 13 gang seems to own the corner. \"The other side there\u0027s no drunk people, no people looking for drugs,\" said Figueroa, who sweeps her sidewalk regularly. \"The other side is so clean. Even the sidewalk is clean. \"You see the street?\" she asked, pointing to a pile of litter. \"That\u0027s terrible.\" Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the area, conceded that the Gateway is not getting its share of services. \"It\u0027s difficult to get a library in there, because no matter where you put a library in the Gateway, you only serve a limited number of city residents,\" she said. \"It\u0027s difficult to get a street cleaning service on a regular basis because they have to come from somewhere else to get there. . . . It\u0027s not like having a nice, round community where you have something in the middle and it serves everybody around it.\" The United Way apparently agrees. In March, the umbrella agency\u0027s Harbor/Southeast division declared Harbor Gateway an \"under-served geographic area,\" citing \"real gaps in law enforcement\" and social services. The declaration is part of a long-term plan by the United Way to upgrade Harbor Gateway by organizing neighborhood leaders to form nonprofit programs for residents. A citizens group, chaired by Haddon, is setting goals for the project, apparently marking the first time that community leaders around the Gateway have come together to talk about the area\u0027s problems. The minister and some others agree that the first goal should be improving community pride and cohesiveness to create political clout. To do that, residents must reverse 82 years of history. Over the years, since the so-called Shoestring Strip Annexation of Dec. 26, 1906, Harbor Gateway residents have somehow coalesced into five distinct neighborhoods. From north to south, their rough boundaries are El Segundo Boulevard to Rosecrans Avenue; Rosecrans to Redondo Beach Boulevard; Redondo Beach to Artesia Boulevard; Artesia to 190th Street; and 190th Street to Sepulveda Boulevard. The east-west boundaries of the three northern neighborhoods are Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street, while Western and Normandie avenues bound the two in the south. Overall, Harbor Gateway is a racially mixed, middle-income area, with an estimated median household income of $30,431 and a population that is 48.4% white, 13.2% black, 16.5% Asian and 21.8% other racial groups, according to the 1980 census, the most recent statistics available. Latinos -- whose numbers are not tallied as part of the racial breakdown in the 1980 census -- are Harbor Gateway\u0027s largest minority group, accounting for 32.9% of the overall population, according to census data. However, the picture changes when the area is more closely examined. Demographic statistics show that the various Gateway neighborhoods often resemble adjacent communities more closely than they do one another. For example, the two Gateway neighborhoods near south South-Central Los Angeles and Compton have the heaviest concentration of blacks, 44.7%. Whites make up 23.6% of those two neighborhoods, which extend north from Redondo Beach Boulevard, and Asians make up 6.9%. The estimated median household income there is $27,453. Make-Up of Community But in the strip\u0027s midsection, from Artesia Boulevard to 190th Street, the population reflects that of the southern end of Gardena, which is heavily Asian. There, the black population is minuscule -- just 0.4% -- with most of the population split between whites, 48.1%, and Asians, 44.8%. Estimated household income in this section jumps dramatically, to $44,498. And south of 190th Street, approaching predominantly white Torrance, the white population jumps even higher, to 66.3%, while the Asian population dips to 8.6% and the number of blacks rises slightly, to 2%. Median household income is $27,607. Although it is primarily residential, the Gateway also includes a burgeoning business district at the San Diego and Harbor freeways, where, according to the California Department of Transportation, 500,000 cars drive by each day, making it the second-busiest intersection in Southern California. The so-called 190th Street Corridor is a major drawing card for commercial developers, who have built about 5 million square feet of office space there in the last eight years. Gleaming high-rises with pleasant landscaping have replaced a Shell oil refinery and manufacturing plants. \"We sort of had a shift from the Industrial Age to the Information Age,\" said Howard Mann, president of Andrex Development Co., one of the area\u0027s major developers. Mann predicts that the move away from industrial to commercial uses will help upgrade nearby areas by attracting home buyers who hold high-paying jobs in what he calls Harbor Gateway\u0027s \"urban cluster.\" Already, he is planning a restaurant to meet that market, based on an analysis that, he said, \"found that the average income per household within a 5-mile radius of this intersection is $50,000.\" Dining in elegance, however, is certainly not a priority farther north in Harbor Gateway, where large concentrations of undocumented Latinos residents are struggling to get by. A study by the United Way found that illegal Latino immigrants are the \"most under-served\" group in the Gateway. Haddon and other local leaders said their presence also makes it difficult to form neighborhood coalitions because illegal aliens fear they will attract unwanted attention from immigration authorities if they participate in community affairs. \"Their need is to be invisible,\" the minister said, \"and that does not make for a good community.\" Haddon is particularly attuned to the problems of undocumented residents because his church runs the 3-year-old Harbor Gateway Center, one of only two social service agencies the United Way found serving the strip. Center\u0027s Problems The center -- which offers a variety of nutritional, health and educational programs to about 1,500 people -- lacks money and staff. The executive director left more than a year ago when the money to pay her ran out. Haddon, who took the pastor\u0027s job in July, has been doing her job ever since. United Way officials say they would like to strengthen the center and also persuade social service agencies in neighboring communities to expand operations here. Their study showed that the area lacks adequate shelters for battered women, delinquency prevention programs, drug- and alcohol-abuse programs and crisis intervention centers. If there is one common thread in the complaints from Gateway residents, it is the increasing gang activity and the lack of police protection. Many said that they go for days without seeing a patrol car and that officers covering the area are often sent on calls elsewhere. Los Angeles police officials said they have been trying to improve service, especially during the past year when citizens groups and Flores have pressed for additional patrols. But they also acknowledged that cars are called out of the area more often than they would like. Capt. Sandy Wasson of the Los Angeles Police Department\u0027s Southeast Division, which covers the part of the strip north of the San Diego Freeway, took issue with residents who say Harbor Gateway gets less than its fair share of coverage. He said a recent deployment study showed that while the area has fewer patrol cars -- just one basic car in the north and one in the south -- it also has less crime. Wasson said he views Harbor Gateway as \"a neighborhood in transition that\u0027s got great potential.\" He has encouraged the formation of neighborhood watch groups. Flores, for one, said she senses a growing participation in such groups and \"a renewed interest in community improvement.\" She maintained that the city has improved services in recent years, especially police coverage. She also noted that a Harbor Gateway paramedic unit was established in June and that this year, the city Library Department finally included a proposal for a Harbor Gateway branch in its long-term plan. The councilwoman said she would like the Gateway to have its own post office and ZIP code. \"I think it\u0027s important,\" she said, \"to have an actual tag and title on who you are and where you are.\" But she said she knows persuading the federal government will be difficult. In the meantime, Flores said, she is thankful for whatever recognition the new name has brought the area. \"At least,\" she said, \"I know that when I mention Harbor Gateway in City Council now, my colleagues know what I\u0027m talking about.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition LAWMEN STRIVE TO GET DRUNK DRIVERS OFF ROADS New Year\u0027s Eve party-goers who drink and drive faced a greater chance of beginning 1989 in jail as law enforcement officers fanned out in unusually heavy numbers Saturday to rid Southern California roadways of drunk drivers. The California Highway Patrol, which reported one freeway traffic death blamed on a drunk driver late Friday, canceled days off for many officers so they could staff an \"Operation Impaired Driver\" task force in the downtown area New Year\u0027s Eve. The 42-officer unit, double the usual deployment against drunk drivers, concentrated on the heavily traveled freeways -- the Santa Monica, Harbor, Pasadena, Golden State and Hollywood -- that converge in downtown Los Angeles. \"They\u0027ll be out there just to look for drunken drivers, to stop them and arrest them,\" CHP Officer Diane Lowery said. \"It means that there will also be more officers to assist any motorists needing help.\" Roadblock in Burbank The CHP scheduled no New Year\u0027s Eve sobriety checkpoints, but at least one local law enforcement agency, the Burbank Police Department, planned a roadblock to snare drunk drivers beginning about one hour before dark at an undisclosed location, Police Lt. Don Brown said. CHP officers stopped 800 drivers at a sobriety checkpoint Friday night in Baldwin Park, arresting five on suspicion of driving under the influence. Police in Los Angeles set up a van that houses their Immediate Booking and Release System behind Parker Center police headquarters, where it was to be in operation from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. New Year\u0027s Day. Traffic officers throughout the city planned \"maximum deployment,\" utilizing all available officers and assigning them specially to look for motorists under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Agencies Beef Up Patrols Several law agencies in Orange County also planned beefed-up patrols. In Costa Mesa, seven two-officer teams will look for drunk drivers, then put them behind bars with the help of specially assigned jail personnel, Police Sgt. Tom Winter said. The CHP reported one alcohol-related traffic death about 11 p.m. Friday, six hours into the agency\u0027s holiday fatality reporting period that ends midnight Monday. Rene Rodriquez, 21, was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter after the fiery crash on the Harbor Freeway near El Segundo Boulevard in South-Central Los Angeles. Investigators said Rodriquez drove his Datsun 280Z onto the freeway at about 100 m.p.h. When he swerved to avoid other traffic, the car struck the center divider and flipped on its side, skidding along the cement divider for 250 yards as it burst into flames. Passenger Dies A passenger, Raul Trevino, 28, of Lawndale, was trapped inside the car and killed. Rodriquez escaped with minor injuries. The CHP recorded four traffic deaths during the New Year\u0027s holiday period last year in Los Angeles County. Statewide, 43 people were killed. CHP officers arrested 467 people for suspected drunk driving in Los Angeles County last year and made 1,874 arrests statewide.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition 2 MEN SLAIN AS 1988 SHOOTINGS SET A RECORD Two young men were killed and four people wounded as drive-by gunmen and street gangs marked the beginning of the long holiday weekend with a series of shootings, ending 1988 with record mayhem. The weekend\u0027s first fatal shooting occurred at 9 p.m. Friday in South Los Angeles, where Raymond Smith, 21, was shot and killed, apparently by occupants of a passing car, as he stood in the 200 block of West 84th Street, Lt. Bob Hansohn said. Nearby, 20 minutes later, Adam Lopez, 16, was shot to death from a passing car as he walked out of a liquor store at 54th and Hoover streets. The two shootings were not believed to be related. Hansohn, of the 77th Street Division, said no suspects had been taken into custody but the shootings \"would probably turn out to be\" gang-related. Three other shootings, all in an area west of downtown, were apparently retaliatory attacks involving two rival gangs, Sgt. Ray Heslop of the Rampart Division said Saturday. Those shootings left four people wounded, two of them critically. Heslop said Edward Moran, 21, of Tujunga, was driving past a group of men gathered on a front porch on Witmer Street between 3rd and 6th streets at 11:30 p.m. Friday, when they yelled out gang slogans and fired three shots, Heslop said. Moran was hit once in the leg. Nearby, Ramon Gomez, 24, was standing at the corner of Temple Street and Edgeware Road at 1 a.m. Saturday when two men drove past in a car and fired three shots from a small caliber revolver, Heslop said. He was wounded in the knee. Heslop said the shooting \"was apparently\" by the same gang members who had fired at Moran from the sidewalk and who had gotten into a car to continue the gunplay. A third shooting, possibly related to the first two, occurred at 2:30 a.m. near Crown Hill Street and Loma Drive when several shots were fired from an unknown source into a group of young men and women, critically wounding a man in the arm and back, and a woman in the chest and back, Heslop said. Both victims were taken to the County-USC Medical Center. Their names were not released. The killings in the 77th Street Division were not included in either the Sheriff\u0027s or Police Department\u0027s preliminary statistics, which indicated 1988 would end with record totals of gang violence. The Police Department reported 207 gang killings in the first 10 months of the year, a 24.7% jump over the 166 in the same period of 1987. The Sheriff\u0027s Department, which patrols unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County and contracts its services to smaller cities, reported 94 gang killings in 1988, an 18.1% increase over 1987. Although police statistics were available only through October, the sheriff\u0027s report, issued Friday, backed up statements by Sheriff Sherman Block that gang violence was on a dramatic rise.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition THE YEAR THE AMERICAN MOVIE CAME BACK; \u0027ACCIDENTAL TOURIST\u0027 TOPS THE TIMES\u0027 CRITIC\u0027S 10 BEST OF 1988 There are years when a look back over the year\u0027s most significant films for that arbitrary ten comes with what one writer once called that nasty ratcheting sound made by scraping the bottom of the barrel. Then there are years when each move to pare down to only 10 brings hours of remorse and deliberation. And oddly enough, this was one of those killer years. As it warmed up, 1988 may not have seemed fated to be an extra superbly choicest year, if you could grade movies the way they grade tea. But it gained momentum after a slow first half until finally the year could be chalked up as fat, full and innovative. You cannot fault innovation, not in the same calendar year that marked \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and \"Little Dorrit,\" but full is certainly a big part of that equation. Between new screens cropping up like mushrooms after a rain and the insatiable maw of video, which insists that movies at least curtsy on a big screen before being gulped down into the small one, we are seeing roughly 60 more films now than we did in 1982. When you are staring, dumbfounded, at the marshamallowed dimensions of a film like \"Zelly and Me\" it can seem a particularly high psychic price to pay, simply to fill more theater screens. Particularly when some of the theaters are roughly the size of an airline washroom, and flood with light whenever late-comers shuffle into to one of their 45 seats. Then a film like \"The Chocolate War\" gets its crack at one of those screens, giving audiences a chance to discover the strengths of its astonishingly assured young debuting director, Keith Gordon, and it all seems worth it again. 1988 may be remembered as the point at which the quintessentially American movie came back into its own, giving us the outright delights of \"Punchline,\" \"Bull Durham,\" \"Big,\" \"8 Men Out,\" \"Roger Rabbit,\" \"Dominick and Eugene,\" \"Tucker\" or \" Working Girl.\" It was also the year for films adapted from exceptionally knotty books, and succeed or fail, the determination involved in \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being,\" \"The Accidental Tourist,\" \"Little Dorrit,\" \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" \"Pelle the Conqueror\" and \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" had to be admired. Art, music and even food had their day on the screen with \"The Moderns,\" \"Vincent,\" \"Bird\" \"Long Live the Lady\" and \"Babette\u0027s Feast.\" By and large, films with urgent social or political issues still came with passports or not at all: \"A World Apart,\" \"Hotel Terminus: the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie,\" \"A Cry in the Dark,\" \"Salaam Bombay!\" In some cases it was a foreign-born director who took on American social issues, the case of \"Betrayed\" and \"Mississippi Burning.\" The 10 films that impressed me most this year are below, ranked in order, with special notice that \"Punchline\" very nearly threw the whole matter into a tie. So, the runner up-list is a hair\u0027s breath one this year. 1. \"It\u0027s not just how much you love someone,\" William Hurt as a grieving father muses in \"The Accidental Tourist,\" \"it\u0027s who you are when you\u0027re with them.\" Director-co-writer Lawrence Kasdan has made watching this man come alive, perhaps for the first time, into a small-scale epiphany. What\u0027s startling is how this story, which takes place during Hurt\u0027s second year of mourning, can be as funny as it is. However, like Anne Tyler\u0027s singular book, the humor comes from character and the family Hurt springs from is memorable enough to have escaped from Dickens. Among the excellent ensemble, all of whom seem to have a decidedly droll bent and a knack for underplaying, you can find the irresistible Geena Davis. She plays a dog obedience trainer to whom Hurt\u0027s Welsh corgi, Edward, takes an enormous shine. It\u0027s entirely understandable. 2. \"Little Dorrit\u0027s\" virtues are not simply its off-handed display of the cream of British actors: Derek Jacobi, Alec Guinness, Miriam Margolyes, Roshan Seth, Joan Greenwood, Eleanor Bron, Cyril Cusack, but the toughness and accomplishment with which director Christine Edzard\u0027s adaptation makes Dickens as pertinent as this week\u0027s stock-fixing headlines. The qualities which made George Bernard Shaw call the novel \"more seditious than \"Das Kapital\" are here in abundance and Edzard asks that we see the story in two films, six hours in all; however her method is not epic but intimate. By the time we have come to Dorrit\u0027s triumphant conclusion, the faces, and voices of London at that time, the working poor as well as the drawling rich, have been stamped upon us forever. 3. \"A Cry in the Dark\" is an angry film, an outraged one really, as director Fred Schepisi lays out the almost unbelieveable path of Australian jurisprudence and/or media hijinks by which a bereft mother became, in the eyes of the public, the ritual killer of her own infant daughter. Its power comes from Schepisi\u0027s blend of passion and detachment and from the best performance Meryl Streep has given so far. (Do we seem to write this each year? If so, it\u0027s true -- this is a talent you can watch deepen and become further refined with each role.) Streep has a perfectly matched thoroughbred opposite her in Sam Neill; he makes this Seventh Day Adventist pastor\u0027s fall from smugness and self-assurance a wracking business. 4. \"Salaam, Bombay!\" throws us into the life of Bombay\u0027s street kids with an ebullience and an energy that\u0027s matched exactly by the film\u0027s tough-mindedness. Director Mira Nair asks for no pity for her urchins and she doesn\u0027t romanticize them either, but there is no way you cannot be haunted by them. \"Salaam Bombay!\" is not Nair\u0027s first film about exploitation as a way of life in India\u0027s cities, but it is her first non-documentary and she brings to her work a wonderful eye and a truly cinematic flair for story telling. As you leave 10-year old Krishna, you may be reminded of \"The 400 Blows,\" sacrilegious as that may sound. But \"Salaam Bombay!\" didn\u0027t win Nair the Camera D\u0027Or at Cannes in 1988, for best new director, for nothing. 5. In a year of largely literal films, the poetry of Wim Wenders\u0027 \"Wings of Desire\" soars, on the wings of his two Berliner angels, with Peter Handke\u0027s screenplay and with the camera of Henri Alekan, who might be considered something of an expert on black and white fairy tales, since it was he who also photographed \"Beauty and the Beast.\" Peter Falk gives the film a wry, gutsy center, but its essence is its passionate declaration of the need for trust, love and commitment; a cheerfully anachronistic, contagiously optimistic tack. 6. In a way, Austrian director Percy Adlon was working on the same wavelength in \"Bagdad Cafe\" that Wenders was in \"Wings of Desire,\" although Adlon was playing a little more with the elements of personal discovery. Those qualities make \"Bagdad Cafe\" a slow-burning fuse, whose charm grows on you like its great and haunting song, \"I\u0027m Calling You.\" Its story of two heartily unalike women, the American CCH Pounder, the Bavarian Marianne Sagebrecht, who meet and join forces against a largely disinterested world in the California desert, depends largely on the charm of ex-cabaret artist Sagebrecht and long-time theater actress Pounder. Both of them are exceptional, but Sagebrecht carries a special something extra, as anyone who saw her in \"Sugarbaby\" will remember. 7. Ostensibly about a \"failed\" car manufacturer, \"Tucker,\" is Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s tribute to America\u0027s loners, its dreamers, whether they make ballpoint pens, or vast unflyable airplanes like the film\u0027s enigma, Howard Hughes. (Or, by the smallest stretch, if they make roundly disliked movies.) Loose-limbed and innovative, fueled by a full-throttle performance by Jeff Bridges as Tucker, it\u0027s a film that could have used more of the darker tones of Tucker\u0027s life -- heaven knows there were enough of them. But scenes like the launching of \"The car of tomorrow, today\" or the mysterioso meeting between Tucker and Dean Stockwell\u0027s Howard Hughes do a lot toward shutting down minor complaints. 8. The beauty and control David Cronenberg uses to tell his melancholy, macabre tale of symbiotic twin doctors in \"Dead Ringers\" shows the director at a new high of maturity, and Jeremy Irons\u0027 dual portrayal as one bordering on the eerie. Dealing, again, with the body, its mysteries and its final frightening independence from what we would have it do, \"Dead Ringers\"\u0027 twins are loosely based on a real Manhattan pair, but they are more plainly metaphors for any relationship that begins in love and ends in pathology. To think of a film this assured, this unified and this dizzyingly potent, you have to go back to \"Blue Velvet.\" 9. \"Red Sorghum\" makes you suspect that its director, 37-year old Zhang Yimou, was cinema-doomed from the cradle: His saga, which ends during the Japanese invasion of China, is part folk-tale, part love story and completely thrilling to behold. To credit this as Zhang\u0027s directorial debut is not to tell the whole story: before this he has also been a masterly cinematographer (\"Yellow Earth,\" \"The Big Parade) and an actor whose performance in \"The Old Well\" won him first prize at Tokyo\u0027s Film Festival. It\u0027s especially interesting to see a film from modern China with the scale and sensibilities about nature of the Kurosawa of \"Dersu Uzala.\" 10. After you see \"A World Apart\" you realize that the great film about South Africa is still waiting to be made. However, this personal one, the homage by a daughter to her martyred mother -- the first white woman jailed under South Africa\u0027s 90-day detention law -- as empathetically directed by Chris Menges, is a firm step in that direction. Three memorably fine performances came out of this: Barbara Hershey and young Jodhi May as mother and daughter; Linda Mvusi as their housekeeper. If somehow the facts of existence in South Africa had escaped you, \" A World Apart\" might be the perfect place to start. Those hotly close runners-up are \"Punchline,\" \"The Moderns,\" \"Babette\u0027s Feast,\" \"8 Men Out,\" \"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,\" \"Last Temptation of Christ,\" \"Hotel Terminus: the Life and times of Klaus Barbie,\" \"Track 29,\" \"Vincent\" and \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\" SHEILA BENSON\u0027S TOP TEN 1. \"The Accidental Tourist\" 2. \"Little Dorrit\" 3. \"A Cry in the Dark\" 4. \"Salaam Bombay!\" 5. \"Wings of Desire\" 6. \"Bagdad Cafe\" 7. \"Tucker\" 8. \"Dead Ringers\" 9. \"Red Sorghum\" 10. \"A World Apart\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition MORE FILM FAVORITES OF 1988 \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" -- It was a year of superb novel adaptations, \"Little Dorrit\" included. But Milan Kundera\u0027s tale of love, politics, sex and repression in \u002760s-\u002770s Czechoslovakia was fashioned here, by director Philip Kaufman, into a genuine watershed American film: A startling departure -- in form, style, psychological and social content -- from almost all of the \u002780s\u0027 mainline U.S. studio product. \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" -- Did most of the people who kicked up the fuss really see Martin Scorsese\u0027s movie -- or understand what they saw? From Kazantzakis\u0027 novel, a firmly Christian work of high idealism, beautifully mounted, not intentionally lewd or blasphemous; only Paul Schrader\u0027s street-tough dialogue keeps it from being a masterpiece. \"Melo\" -- Henri Bernstein\u0027s tense play about a tragic quadrangle in a world of classical musicians: The very title suggests \"melodrama,\" and director Alain Resnais has defiantly refused to \"open it up.\" Never moving from an obvious proscenium set, it somehow seems to distill the soul of theater, the beating heart of 1929 Paris. \"Wings of Desire\" -- Writer Peter Handke, master cinematographer Henri Alekan and director Wim Wenders -- cinematic poet of alienated loners on the road -- create an eerie, rapt modern fairy tale in which Berlin angels watch over the monochrome world of the lost and lonely and yearn for the bright colored day of passion, circuses and love. \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" -- A monstrous high-voltage audience-hit from director Robert Zemeckis, that, like John McTiernan\u0027s \"Die Hard,\" was also a technical marvel. I\u0027d like the last trip to Toonvile to be more surrealistic, crazier; otherwise, it doesn\u0027t miss a trick. \"A Taxing Woman\" -- Through the Byzantine financial catacombs of modern Japan, a piquant tax investigator pursues a swaggering cheat. Director Juzo Itami (\"Tampopo,\") gives us a wry, piercing, hawk-eyed view of his country\u0027s new commercialism, its loss of tradition and the samurai heart that seems to beat beneath it\u0027s plexiglass shield. \"The Moderns\" -- Supposedly it takes place in the expatriate\u0027s Paris of 1926, but actually this movie -- drifting along on its cloud of soft jazz, overlapping banter and wine-rich colors -- is set in no real landscape at all. A sweet, devious meditation on art, love, life and artifice; the most special and delightful of Alan Rudolph\u0027s films. \"Tucker\" -- Cars and conspiracies, invention and intimidation, flash and free enterprise; Francis Coppola strongly reclaims his turf. A full-throated shout of American optimism, tinged with fatalism and a canny awareness of the traps awaiting any dreamer. \"Bird\" -- A jazz lover\u0027s dream: A song in darkness, joy wrung out of grief. No director this year showed more devotion to his/her subject matter than Clint Eastwood in this soulful elegy to Charlie Parker and the world of \u002740s-\u002750s be-bop. \"Long Live the Lady!\" -- A neglected little gem, by Ermanno Olmi, that I like as much as the better-known culinary fable \"Babette\u0027s Feast\" (not to mention its wonderful Danish compatriot, \"Pelle the Conqueror\"). It\u0027s a community comedy about lower-class waiters at a lavish Italian mountaintop business banquet; a feast that becomes, like Babette\u0027s, a metaphor for all the traps of society, all the divisions of life.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition STAGE \u002788; 1988: IT WAS A BATTLE; BUT LATC -- AND OTHERS -- CAME THROUGH WITH STRONG SHOWS A surprising amount of good work got done in Los Angeles theater in 1988, considering that it was a war year. For months, Actors\u0027 Equity and the smaller theaters fought out the question of how to compensate Waiver actors. This at least established the principle that Waiver actors deserved compensation. But it also used up a lot of energy. By year\u0027s end, you had to hope that the Waiver wars were winding down: Everybody was sick of them. Meanwhile, the smaller theaters got on with it. A fine young writer named Jamie Baker had a double debut. His \"Don\u0027t Go Back to Rockville\" was first seen at the Pacific Theatre Ensemble, then at the Victory Theatre. Set in 1944, it concerned a surly young Kentucky Derby jockey named Ed (Andrew Philpot). His unaffectionate progeny turned up a few months later at the Tamarind Theater in Baker\u0027s \"South Central Rain.\" Ed and his nasty-nice spawn didn\u0027t have a lot to recommend them as human beings, but they had a sneaky vitality as stage characters. They suggested Lanford Wilson\u0027s Talley clan, except that they didn\u0027t come off as \"characters,\" but as people with real needs -- even if selfish ones. Volume Three of this family saga is awaited with interest. Rafael Lima also hit the mark with \"El Salvador\" at the Gnu Theatre. The scene here was a hotel room from which a group of journalists were trying to cover the war in El Salvador without getting their heads shot off, and the message was that this kind of life can get to be addictive. An oddly effective combination of \"The Front Page\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" tautly directed by the Gnu\u0027s Jeff Seymour. It was an election year, and the Bush-Dukakis debates provided playacting of a dim sort. But there weren\u0027t many overtly political plays. Jeff Goldsmith\u0027s \"McCarthy\" at the Odyssey came closest, a somewhat overwritten script, but with two lean and mean performances: Victor Brandt as Tail Gunner Joe and Ralph Seymour as Roy Cohn. AIDS remained a scourge. \"Jerker\" -- the notorious script by Robert Chesley that the FCC had found pornographic when it was performed on KPFK -- got a live production at the Fifth Estate Theatre. It ended with a tired voice saying, over a Judy Garland record, that he couldn\u0027t come to the phone right now but please leave a message. No more needed to be said. In larger theaters, the best work, and certainly the most work, was done by the Los Angeles Theatre Center. Not everything that LATC attempted came off, but each of its shows had a reason for being and left a sense that somebody at the theater was in its corner. LATC introduced us to two playwrights with imagination and control, Jose Rivera and Marlane Meyer. Rivera was born in Puetro Rico, and his \"The Promise\" was a wild juxtaposition of family drama and tall tale, set in a world as real as a rusty muffler, yet a world where demons came and went. Marlane Meyer gave us two plays, \"Etta Jenks\" and \"Kingfish.\" The first brought back to life the cliche of the girl who goes to the dogs when she tries to break into the movies. Meyer\u0027s script worked because it dealt with the grungy Hollywood that actually exists, as opposed to the Oz of popular imagination; and because Meyer didn\u0027t waste any time sentimentalizing over Etta. (Actress Deirdre O\u0027Connell didn\u0027t sentimentalize her, either.) \"Kingfish\" concerned a non-existent dog who nonetheless existed, since it was to the interest of certain parties that he do so. This could have been a terribly precious play. Perhaps the conceptual framework imposed on it by director David Schweizer was a bit precious. But, again, Meyer knew her people. She knew, for instance, that a lonely bachelor (Buck Henry) might covet a son (Merritt Butrick) so badly that he would pay to have one. This script didn\u0027t go any farther out than human behavior does. We\u0027re just not used to seeing it go this far in the theater. LATC also took on the Russians. Stein Winge\u0027s nightmarish production of \"The Inspector General\" got all tangled up in its bedclothes, but Ron Campbell proved wonderfully idiotic in the lead. Charles Marowitz\u0027s staging of \"The Sea Gull\" was dead-on: a production that called Chekhov\u0027s characters to account, rather than issuing them a blanket pardon because they were all so sensitive. Bill Bushnell\u0027s staging of Alexander Galin\u0027s \"Stars in the Morning Sky\" didn\u0027t redeem a pedestrian script about some played-out whores in \"protective custody\" during the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Nevertheless, as with \"Sarcophagus\" in \u002787, the play was an interesting theater event -- further proof that Soviet playwrights no longer have to pretend that they live in Utopia. This was the pattern at LATC last year: Even when the play fell short, the viewer could grab onto something. Another example: Chloe Webb\u0027s exuberant performance as the schizophrenic daughter in \"The Model Apartment.\" LATC is on a roll these days: You can feel the energy in the lobby. The only time you felt that energy in the Mark Taper Forum lobby in \u002788 was after \"The Colored Museum.\" Younger viewers, black and white, had been exhilarated by the anger in George C. Wolfe\u0027s script, while older people suspected that Wolfe was reviving the hurtful black stereotypes of the past, under the guise of satirizing them. Few other Taper plays proved so stimulating: Certainly not its yuppified production of George Walker\u0027s \"Nothing Sacred.\" It was good to see Joe Chaikin back at Taper, Too. Director Robert Woodruff kept Sam Shepard\u0027s loose-jointed \"A Lie of the Mind\" all in one piece. Ron Taylor gave a tremendous supporting performance in \"Lost Highway.\" But it was a season that said \"Me, too\" rather than, as in the old days at the Taper, \"Look at this!\" Or are we romanticizing the old days? \"Fences\" was the Doolittle\u0027s big hit, with James Earl Jones even more resonant than he had been on Broadway, and Lynne Thigpen taking no garbage as his wife. Another August Wilson play, \"Joe Turner\u0027s Come and Gone,\" played the Old Globe Theatre prior to Broadway, with Delroy Lindo as a self-flaying fugitive. The Pasadena Playhouse, once given up for dead, had a fine year. Amanda McBroom starred in the splendid \"Lies and Legends,\" based on Harry Chapin\u0027s songs. The show later transferred to Beverly Hills. We can\u0027t understand why Robert Harling\u0027s beauty-parlor comedy \"Steel Magnolias\" didn\u0027t make a similar transfer. Barbara Rush and the rest of the cast loved doing it, the audience loved watching it, and even a critic had to acknowledge that behind the sitcom rhythms, there was a genuine admiration here for the way women can get it together. As opposed to men. Jules Feiffer\u0027s \"Carnal Knowledge\" at the Playhouse had Gregory Harrison and David Marshall Grant as two guys who treat women like The Enemy, and end up sandbagging themselves. This was also the predicament of Sean Penn, Danny Aiello and the other scuzzy Hollywood guys in \"Hurlyburly,\" staged by playwright David Rabe at the Westwood Playhouse. Disgracefully, the \"Hurlyburly\" company canceled a performance just before curtain-time, the excuse being that their friend Gary Busey had just had a motorcycle accident. The professional reaction, in this circumstance, is to dedicate the performance to your friend and go on. Nonetheless, Penn and his colleagues -- including Mare Winningham as the toughest of their lady friends -- gave \"Hurlyburly\" one hell of a ride. The funniest classical revival of the year was South Coast Repertory\u0027s \"School for Scandal,\" which director Paul Marcus set in a strange land where 18th-Century types read the National Enquirer. SCR also brought us an urgent revival of \"The Crucible,\" directed by Martin Benson -- one of those shows where the audience gasps even when it knows what\u0027s coming next. In San Diego, the show of the year was the San Diego Repertory Theatre\u0027s \"Red Noses,\" Peter Barnes\u0027 black comedy about the uses of comedy in a bad time. Co-produced with the Dell\u0027Arte Players of Blue Lake, Calif., the production combined expert clowning and scathing satire. Only one show gave us more pure pleasure during 1988 -- the Moscow Circus.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition POP EYE: CLINKERS AMONG THE POP NOTES OF \u002788 Everybody hooted last January when Texas record producer (and legendary self-promoter) Major Bill Smith concocted an Elvis Presley birthday tribute, \"Hey! Big E. Happy 53!,\" claiming The King had faked his death so he could live in anonymity. But Major Bill had the last laugh. In a year when Brian Wilson, Patti Smith and Jimmy Page\u0027s comebacks flopped, Elvis had the biggest revival of all, making tabloid headlines, starring in Priscilla\u0027s best-seller and being celebrated in a musical about his life. By the end of the year, you got the feeling Elvis was on tour again -- popping up at Burger Kings in Kalamazoo, car washes in Georgia and the parking lot of a Las Vegas hotel. In August, WCVG in Cincinnati switched to an all-Elvis format. In September, Cheap Trick\u0027s \"Don\u0027t Be Cruel\" became the first Elvis re-make to go Top 10. In November, Priscilla and Lisa Marie did an Olds ad. In December, an L.A. Elvis impersonator announced plans to turn his San Fernando Valley home into a mock Graceland. Even without Elvis, 1988 was a banner year for pop follies. So let\u0027s celebrate the music world\u0027s clown princes in our yearly round-up of dubious achievements, inglorious moments and show-biz scams. PRESENTER OF THE YEAR: Beach Boy Mike Love, who livened up the 1988 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Awards by noisily blasting Mick Jagger: \"We did 180 performances last year. . . . I\u0027d like to see Mick Jagger get on stage and do \u0027I Get Around\u0027 rather than \u0027Jumpin\u0027 Jack Flash.\u0027 Mick\u0027s always been chicken to get on stage with the Beach Boys.\" JAIL SENTENCE: To the Yugoslav folk singer who was sentenced to 60 days in jail and fined $80 for refusing to sing \"Comrade Tito, We Pledge to You That We Will Not Swerve From Your Path,\" an official state song glorifying Marshal Tito, founder of the country\u0027s Communist Party. PRINCE FAN: Richard Nixon, who titled his latest political tract \"1999.\" NATIONAL ANTHEM PERFORMANCE: Saxophonist Kenny G, whose anthem rendition at the sixth game of the National League playoffs here was blasted as \"unbelievably terrible\" by Dodger second baseman Steve Sax. \"I can\u0027t believe it. It was the worst I ever heard. I could have played it better than he did,\" said Sax, who was so upset that he shook his fist at G while walking back to the dugout. Dodger right fielder Mike Marshall added: \"It was a disgrace to America.\" QUOTE, PART 1: Debbie Gibson: \"On Halloween, I had a party where we had a seance. We tried to contact Liberace and Sid Vicious.\" DRUG BUST: Reporting that soul legend James Brown was charged for possession of the hallucinogenic drug PCP after a car chase through two states this fall, Rolling Stone quoted a Georgia Highway patrolman who said that when arrested, Brown \"started singing \u0027Georgia\u0027 and was doing his \u0027Good Foot\u0027 dance when we gave him the sobriety test.\" GRAMMY ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: Best Female Country Vocal Performance winner K.T. Oslin, who told the press: \"I\u0027m so excited that I feel like I\u0027m going to throw up any minute now.\" PUBLIC ADDRESS ANNOUNCER: Paul Strelzin, announcer for the Texas League\u0027s El Paso Diablos, was ejected from a game against the Jackson Mets after infuriating umpires by repeatedly playing the verse \"I\u0027ve been cheated, been mistreated\" from Linda Ronstadt\u0027s \"When Will I Be Loved\" after a series of close calls at first base. BACKSTAGE STIFF: When ex-Ollie North secretary Fawn Hall asked to meet Bruce Springsteen backstage at his Washington concert, she received a note saying: \"I didn\u0027t think much of Ollie North, so why should I want to meet his secretary?\" QUOTE, PART 2: Terence Trent D\u0027Arby: \"I\u0027ve had three lives: The first time I was an Ethiopian pirate around 600 BC. Then I was an 18th-Century painter. The last time I was a very talented but unsuccessful country and Western singer.\" RAMONES FAN: Celebrated Manhattan preppie-killer Robert Chambers. He donned a shoulder-length wig and imitated Ramones leader Joey Ramone singing \"Rockaway Beach\" on a videotape that an ex-girlfriend sold to a local New York TV station, which aired the clip earlier this year. SUBPOENA: When contestants in a lawsuit involving former MCA artist Donnie Iris couldn\u0027t persuade MCA Records chairman Irving Azoff to testify in a lawsuit hearing, they served the industry mogul with a subpoena at the Forum during half time of a Lakers-Spurs playoff game. DEEJAY: After the Baltimore Orioles lost 10 straight games, Baltimore morning deejay Bob Rivers swore he would stay locked in his WIYY-FM studio until the team won a game. He ended up stuck on the air for 258 straight hours until the team ended its record 21-game losing streak last April. WORST BAND NAME: Johnny Hates Jazz. MOLL: Dolly Parton, who totes a gun -- legally -- and said she pulled it out of her purse when accosted by a man when she was walking in New York this summer. \"I pointed it at him and told him if he didn\u0027t take a hike, I\u0027d turn him into a soprano.\" LED ZEPPELIN FAN: Spago impresario Wolfgang Puck, who apparently forgot that Jimmy Page was the band\u0027s guitar hero. When ex-Zeppelin singer Robert Plant was in town for a summer concert appearance, Puck presented him with a guitar-shaped pizza. QUOTE, PART 3: Washington Wife crusader Tipper Gore: \"I love rock \u0027n\u0027 roll. I was one of the earliest Springsteen fans. I played drums in high school. You\u0027re talking to someone who really understands rock music.\" EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: During last year\u0027s February sweeps, KABC-TV ballyhooed a chat with ex-Beatle George Harrison as an \"exclusive\" interview -- even though Harrison complained throughout the story about \"all these interviews\" he had been doing. MANAGER: Doc McGhee, whose management firm handles such pop superstars as Bon Jovi and Motley Crue, pleaded guilty last January to importing 40,000 pounds of marijuana, worth $9 million, into the United States. The indictment came weeks after McGhee and partner Doug Thaler were named personal managers of the year in Pollstar magazine\u0027s Readers Poll Awards. OVERSTATEMENT: When the American Cinematheque screened the rarely seen Sex Pistols documentary, \"The Great Rock \u0027n\u0027 Roll Swindle\" in January, festival organizers ballyhooed the showing as \"the last U.S. screening ever.\" This came as a surprise to Julien Temple, the film\u0027s director, who quipped: \"What are they going to do -- burn it?\" FRAGRANCE: John Lennon\u0027s first wife, Cynthia, took advantage of the hoopla surrounding her late husband by launching a new fragrance, Woman perfume. The fragrance was named after the song \"Woman,\" from Lennon\u0027s \"Double Fantasy\" album, even though the ballad was written for Yoko Ono, the woman Lennon left Cynthia to marry. REUNION: When the Stray Cats held a press conference in August to herald the band getting back together after a four-year layoff, the group somehow neglected to mention that they had recorded a reunion album two years ago -- which stiffed. MAGAZINE ISSUE: Spin magazine\u0027s November issue, which contained a free condom in each copy as a symbol of the editors\u0027 support for safe sex practices.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition L.A. BEAT: BEST OF \u002788 WON\u0027T SHATTER ANY TRENDS If your great-aunt\u0027s bridge club donned leather cycle duds and power-chorded its way through songs about life in the gutter, it\u0027d probably stand a good chance of getting a record deal. At least that\u0027s the way it seems, considering the hard-rock feeding frenzy on the part of record companies in the wake of Guns N\u0027 Roses\u0027 multi-platinum breakthrough. And with Geffen having snapped up such promising bands as Little Caesar and Junkyard, there\u0027s no reason to think that frenzy won\u0027t continue well into 1989. Not that the continually healthy street-metal crowd had much competition this year: The best thing you could say about the rest of the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was that nothing really coalesced into any kind of movement that would be easy for trendoids and sycophants to glom onto, meaning that many worthy acts around town were free to develop on their own and not worry about fitting into a \"scene.\" On the other hand, the worst thing about the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was that nothing new really coalesced into any kind of movement that would produce an irresistible buzz, meaning that many worthy acts around town didn\u0027t get the attention they deserved. After all, what does it say about the vitality of the local club circuit when one of the brightest pop hopes to emerge from L.A. in 1988 -- Melissa Etheridge -- determined that playing the clubs was a waste of time and elected to build her career through playing beach community taverns? And who would have thought that the local independent act to get the most media attention would be Ailee Willis \"discoverees,\" the Del Rubio Triplets, three middle-aged sisters who apply their harmonies to the likes of \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" and Willis\u0027 \"Neutron Dance,\" and make most of their concert appearances at nursing and retirement homes? There are, though, two promising trends that began to emerge in \u002788: Nu Folk (the name\u0027s gotta go) and the latest edition of L.A. psychedelia. Such clubs as Bogart\u0027s, Club Lingerie and the Music Machine suddenly swung open their doors to acoustic troubadours, while new clubs like the Breakaway and the Gaslight were created specifically for that low-key approach. (The revived Ash Grove couldn\u0027t make it, though.) Nu names to watch: meaning-seeker Mark Davis and witty social observer Milo Binder seem the most likely to make a mark, while bands Different World and the Beef Sisters could develop into contenders as well. Among the murky mind-expansion brigade, Jane\u0027s Addiction is certainly the most prominent, while fellow late-night denizen Caterwaul also seems a good candidate for big things, based on the preview EP I.R.S. has just issued. An album from the Betsy Martin-fronted quartet is due early this year. The stable of psyche-rock purveyors at Nate Starkman \u0026 Son records also seems quite promising, with Shiva Burlesque, the best of the bunch, reportedly getting some major label attention these days. The best live club act this year was Mary\u0027s Danish, which combines the droll wit and delivery of singers Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager with a wild, loose funk-rock sound. American Martyrs and the Bel-Fires have also both developed strong live presences that seem ripe for big-label vinyl. The Wild Cards, who released a debut LP \"Cool Not Cold,\" also could (finally) be the band to follow fellow Latinos Los Lobos to national attention. And the country world offers potential matinee idol Jim Lauderdale (a debut album coming soon from Epic), country-rock songstresses Lucinda Williams (a new album that more than lives up to her good name around local clubs) and Kimm Rogers.",

We found exactly . . . one. To round out most of the other nine slots in our 1988 Video Top 10, we had to settle for well-executed renditions of the same old song and dance. The year\u0027s best: 1. Joni Mitchell\u0027s \"My Secret Place\" (Director: Anton Corbijn). Perhaps one of the few videos ever made to convey such emotional intimacy, \"Secret\" dramatized a fetching Mitchell and glowing duet partner Peter Gabriel quietly bonding over dinner (!). Warm, subtle and recognizably human, it naturally received almost no airplay. 2. George Harrison\u0027s \"When We Was Fab\" (Godley \u0026 Creme). If the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" film had lived up to its potential, it might have had the charm of this effects-filled clip, a bit of winsome but hard-edged nostalgia for the more psychedelic days of the Fab Four. 3. Michael Jackson\u0027s \"Smooth Criminal\" (Colin Chilvers). A silly but eminently watchable (and rewatchable) 10-minute all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza that\u0027s a marked return to video form for the Gloved One. The best rhythm track off Jackson\u0027s \"Bad\" album is combined with fresh choreography that shows the Fred Astaire comparisons may not be so off base after all. 4. Bruce Springsteen\u0027s \"One Step Up\" (Meiert Avis). Though set in a working-class bar atmosphere far removed from Springsteen\u0027s daily life, this tone poem on marital alienation and straying affections held more resonance for many curious viewers -- like much of the \"Tunnel of Love\" album -- in the face of subsequent events. 5. Nancy Sinatra\u0027s \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin\"\u0027 (Robert Sidney). A re-release of a 22-year-old clip, \"Boots\" demonstrated that -- even with then-acceptable cellulite and relatively modest mini-skirts -- Nancy and her booted dancing partners could out-fox Lita Ford any day. 6. Roy Orbison\u0027s \"Oh Pretty Woman\" (Tony Mitchell). Excerpted from the star-studded cable-TV gala filmed at the Cocoanut Grove. What\u0027s that we see? He\u0027s walkin\u0027 back to us . . . in mementos like this video, at least, if -- sadly -- no longer in life. 7. Steve Winwood\u0027s \"Roll With It\" (David Finchman). What a wonderful fantasy: A night out at a sweaty, sepia-toned, racially integrated bar in which Winwood leads the house soul band. 8. LL Cool J\u0027s \"Goin\u0027 Back to Cali\" (Ric Menello). A New York rapper\u0027s-eye-view of a return to L.A. in which all the cliches (palm trees, cruising) somehow look fresh. 9. Weird Al Yankovic\u0027s \"Fat\" (Jay Levy). Combine the non-stop obesity jokes on the sound track with the non-stop Michael Jackson parody on the screen -- one big non sequitur if ever there was one -- and what you get is a tasteless, pointlessly hilarious guilty pleasure. 10. Sam Brown\u0027s \"Stop\" (Eric Watson). A blond. A red dress. A soulful voice tackling a slow blues ballad. Sometimes life\u0027s simplest pleasures are best.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition THE BLOSSOMING OF L.A. ARTISTS IN \u002788.; MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR PRICES FOR \u0027PRICELESS\u0027 PIECES WERE NUMBING, BUT OUT HERE THE OUTLOOK IS DOWN-TO-EARTH Well, it\u0027s over again. Bits of pastel serpentine weave through the carpet and a champagne cork is wedged into the potted palm. Time to stare out at the garden and ruminate on \u002788. It might have gone down as the year when the tainted opulence of Post-Modernism was in full flower, the spectacle of an art world where aesthetics are swamped by jillionaire collectors flourishing power. Winter: Armand Hammer announced he would jerk his blue-chip collection away from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where it had been promised repeatedly for nearly 20 years. Hammer decided to establish his own private boutique museum in Westwood. Spring: Negotiations aimed at bringing Norton Simon\u0027s fabled collections under the stewardship of UCLA guttered out. Summer: The annual confrontation between the J. Paul Getty Museum and Thomas Hoving\u0027s Connoisseur magazine arrived with the predictability of the gas bill. The Getty bought a rare ancient Greek Aphrodite and Hoving said it had been smuggled out of Italy. Something similar had happened the year before. And the year before that. Fall: New York auctions turned into a feeding frenzy that drove prices for modern art to stratospheric obscenity. A Jasper Johns brought $17 million. A Picasso at $24.75 million, then another in London for $38.5 million. Sales totals in the hundreds of millions. Felt like the Last Days of Pompeii, lavish hysteria. Remember when great art was called \"priceless\"? There was something nice about that. \"Priceless\" said it doesn\u0027t matter if a work of art sells for $50 or $50 million, the experience of it is about something else, something delicate, numinous and poetic. Hard figures vulgarize the expression like a price tag put on the act of love. It could have been remembered as a year of fascinating naughty titivating tattle out of \"Life Styles of the Rich and Arrogant\" but things happened in Los Angeles that evidence significance. A generation of artists who were once art\u0027s quirky Young Turks came to mature fulfillment. This gratifying harvest was probably best symbolized by a man who is not a painter or a sculptor but an architect. Frank Gehry has long been the L.A. art world\u0027s architect -- openly and deeply influenced by everybody from Billy Al Bengston to Robert Irwin. His year began with a traveling retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art. It was a triumph of exhibition design including recreations of copper-clad spiral rooms, a walk-in fish used as an office by somebody with Jonah-in-the-whale fantasies, cardboard tables and chairs that looked like bats wearing bearskin coats, all wonderfully imaginative and gently tough. The next thing you knew, Gehry was the centerpiece of a New York exhibition god-fathered by Philip Johnson. Titled \"Deconstructivist Architecture,\" it placed Gehry at the wellspring position among an international group searching for ways to revivify the modernist structural vocabulary. By year\u0027s end, architectural critics had praised him as the most important practitioner in the country. He became a rare prophet in his own land when he finally received a commission for a key cultural building, the Disney Pavilion at the Music Center. No discouraging word was heard around Gehry\u0027s apotheosis. Clearly deserved, it was nothing but justice done. The rest of the year was punctuated with echoes of the L.A. aesthetic coming to mature ripening. David Hockney\u0027s retrospective at LACMA found the transplanted Brit intelligent, urbane, witty and curious. This artist, who virtually created L.A.\u0027s own hedonistic image of itself -- reflected in the whiplash ripples of its pools -- left us a lot to ponder. Hockney -- sometimes seen as a lightweight who fritters away his gifts on opera sets and Polaroid montages -- can no more be denied the underlying seriousness of his purpose than could Noel Coward. As the months rolled by, the sense of L.A. coming into its own just kept on blossoming. There were external events such as the opening of LACMA\u0027s pavilion for Japanese Art. Housing Joe D. Price\u0027s superb collection of Edo period painting in an imaginative and apt building by the late Bruce Goff provided a curiously exotic harmonic to LACMA\u0027s diverse architectural styles. Curator Stephanie Barron confirmed her expertise and originality in the exhibition \"German Expressionism, The Second Generation.\" But artists -- L.A. artists -- managed to hold center stage. Bengston\u0027s retrospective, still on view at LACMA, added itself to Hockney, and a look back at Richard Diebenkorn\u0027s works on paper headed this way in March from New York. There is an unexpected overlap in their work, in its shared tropical pastel palette and fundamental concern with timeless questions of drawing and composition. They share a degree of calm mastery. Count in the sculptor Robert Graham, whose LACMA showing of his monument to Duke Ellington found him more flexible and more calmly assured than ever. But it was old Ed Moses who came sidewinding out of the chute like a buckaroo on a stoned pony. Paintings seen at L.A. Louver certainly constituted the commercial gallery show of the year, with their crazy Pollock-ribbons of paint kicking open deep space with all the control of a Frank Stella. If a full-dress Moses retrospective is not in the works, there just ain\u0027t no justice. And it was not just The Boys who came up smiling. L.A.\u0027s enduring maverick\u0027s maverick Joyce Treiman was reviewed in a USC exhibition. Her classic painterly realist diary of haunted art fantasies and spiritual insight revealed new depths to even her closest observers. And LACMA tipped our hat to Helen Lundeberg, who was painting around here when our ranking patriarchs were still on tricycles. It left us all knowing that making real art takes a long time. This amazing payoff represents at least three decades of artistic ripening. It was all begun when things were very focused around here. People who paid attention knew all the artists who counted and followed their work in great detail. The people who made the work had anybody\u0027s normal dreams of recognition and reward, but they were going to make their art if it meant two-bit second jobs and a lifetime of spaghetti and cheap red wine. In today\u0027s sprawling, overpopulated, fast-buck climate, where good artists cave in to making corporate decoration and careers blaze and fizzle like flat-tire flares, it\u0027s hard to know where a comparable generation is going to come from in 2025. Art goes on. That there is still serious purpose out there somewhere was well attested by the Anselm Kiefer survey at MOCA. There\u0027s always hope, but the future has a formidable task of sorting ahead. Funny how nice stuff manages to happen in a climate where every charge of vulgarized art and popularized museums is absolutely true. And yet they keep managing to engage us deeply with revelatory revivals, such as LACMA\u0027s current Guido Reni exhibitions, or with once-in-a-lifetime extravaganzas, such as the Metropolitan\u0027s Degas exhibition or the pageant of Paul Gauguin at the National Gallery. Proves there are still good people out there doing the right thing. Proves that no matter how fetid the climate, art is still great stuff.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition VENEZUELA WILL DELAY PAYING DEBT PRINCIPAL In a surprise move, the outgoing president of Venezuela said Saturday that the fourth-biggest debtor in Latin America is suspending principal payments on nearly all of its $30.3-billion debt to foreign banks. The move was not as drastic a step as halting interest payments, but it highlights a hardening of attitudes among Latin American leaders over the worsening economic situation. Enormous Toll Reflected Venezuela, a leading oil exporter, has been a model debtor nation and was the only big Latin American debtor to continue making principal payments through the 1980s. But the decision Saturday reflects the enormous toll being taken on Latin American countries by huge debt payments to foreign banks. The debt crisis, which is entering its seventh year, has choked off growth in many Latin American economies as earnings are devoted to paying foreign debt instead of financing local growth. Latin American leaders have warned that declining living standards threaten the region\u0027s political stability and its fledgling democratic governments. President-elect George Bush said in December that he will order a major review of current U.S. strategy for dealing with Third World debt. He told reporters that \"we\u0027ve got enormous problems, particularly in our own hemisphere, with Third World debt.\" In a nationwide television address announcing the Venezuelan suspension of payments, President Jaime Lusinchi said, \"The problem of foreign debt today strangles the economic and social development of the great majority of the world\u0027s peoples.\" Oil Revenue Slump He said he had ordered the suspension, effective Jan. 17, because of the slump in revenue from oil exports and what he said were high interest rates on the debt. Lusinchi said that Venezuelan officials plan to meet soon with their leading creditor banks to negotiate new terms on the loans. A U.S. banker familiar with Venezuela\u0027s position said the country wants to reduce its loan payments by stretching out the terms of its existing loans. Between 35% and 40% of the $30.3 billion is owed to U.S. banks. Chase Manhattan Bank in New York is Venezuela\u0027s leading U.S. lender. San Francisco-based Bank of America is the second-largest creditor, with $1.1 billion in long-term and medium-term loans. Donald K. Crowley, a banking industry analyst in the San Francisco office of the investment firm of Keefe, Bruyette \u0026 Woods, said the suspension\u0027s impact on U.S. banks would be minimal because none is overexposed in Venezuela. But he said the Venezuelan action came as a shock and would be significant if it represented a move among Latin American nations to adopt a common approach to dealing with foreign creditors, which would give them more bargaining leverage. Colombia\u0027s Suspension On Friday, Colombia said for the first time that it was suspending payment on its $16.5-billion foreign debt for three months until a new $1.7-billion international loan is received. Louis G. Schirano, an executive in the New York offices of Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp., said he did not interpret the Venezuelan move as a major setback. He said that Venezuela, which will continue paying interest on its debt, has simply joined the other Latin debtors in suspending its principal payments. \"What banks really care about is the debt service (interest) and that will still be flowing,\" said Schirano, whose bank has divested itself of all Venezuelan debt. Latin America\u0027s largest debtor nations are Brazil, $113 billion; Mexico, $108 billion; and Argentina, $54 billion. Unlike Venezuela, all three have halted interest payments to foreign banks at various times. Debt Action Urged The presidents of all four nations, along with three other Latin American countries, have urged the United States to make the debt problem a major political priority. Bush\u0027s remarks about reviewing U.S. efforts have been interpreted in some quarters as a move to possibly forgive some portion of the huge debt owed to private banks by Third World countries. The previous U.S. strategy for dealing with the problem, the so-called Baker Plan, was designed in 1985 by then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who will be Bush\u0027s secretary of state. He called for commercial banks and the World Bank to provide new loans in return for growth-oriented economic changes in the debtor nations. But new lending has been rare. The 17 countries that are most deeply in debt owe $529 billion and paid $14 billion more to creditors than they received in new loans in 1987, the latest year for which figures are available. A U.N. development organization said in September that commercial banks should forgive at least 30% of the amount owed by the 15 most heavily indebted Third World countries. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said that was the only way of giving the nations the opportunity to retain enough capital to grow faster and repay the remainder of the debt. While Venezuela\u0027s economy is in better shape than that of most of the other debtors, the sharp two-year decline in oil prices has caused problems. On Friday, the government raised tariffs sharply to restrain imports and conserve its cash reserves. Tariffs were increased as much as 160% on about 500 consumer items, ranging from electronics to liquor.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition U.S.-CHINA STRAINS SURFACE; BASIS OF RELATIONSHIP SHIFTS At the time, Republican presidential contender Ronald Reagan called it \"a shabby, needless blow.\" His intra-party rival, George Bush, branded it \"an abject American retreat.\" And then-Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) termed it \"unconscionable.\" Despite such criticism, 10 years ago today, on Jan. 1, 1979, the Jimmy Carter Administration broke formal U.S. ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with the People\u0027s Republic of China. \"We are recognizing a simple reality,\" President Carter said. But, as a matter of American foreign policy, it had been anything but simple. For nearly three decades, the United States had refused to recognize the Communist regime in Beijing and had pretended that the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan were the government for all of China. Now, 10 years later, the entire relationship between the United States and China has changed. New assumptions govern the behavior of both nations, and U.S. scholars predict that in the next few years the two governments may find themselves in increasing conflict with one another on a number of foreign policy questions, such as the Middle East and Cambodia. \"It seems to me that China and the United States won\u0027t be as close as they were before,\" said Thomas W. Robinson of the American Enterprise Institute. \"There has to be a certain distancing on both sides.\" On the one hand, during the last decade the U.S. recognition of Beijing -- and its avoidance of official dealings with Taiwan -- has become an established, accepted fact in American domestic politics. President Reagan, once one of Taiwan\u0027s closest friends in American politics, honored the U.S. recognition of Beijing last month by saying he is confident that the United States and China will \"forge even stronger ties and build a safer, more prosperous world.\" Taiwan, meanwhile, has managed to survive and prosper despite its diplomatic isolation. No Longer in Tandem On the other hand, the United States and China no longer operate in close tandem with one another in international affairs in the way that they did a decade ago. The common bond of shared opposition to the Soviet Union has frayed as the United States and China separately seek warmer ties with the government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. \"There is an increasing sense that the era in which the bilateral relationship (between the United States and China) was based importantly on opposition to Moscow has ended,\" University of Washington Prof. Nicholas R. Lardy wrote recently. During the last two years the United States and China have been at odds over a number of issues. Chinese Arms Sales an Issue U.S. officials voiced bitter complaints about China\u0027s arms sales to the Middle East, including the sale of Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran and intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia. China took umbrage at U.S. congressional resolutions denouncing China\u0027s policies on human rights and in Tibet. As if to symbolize the current atmosphere of mistrust, China recently imposed new travel restrictions on American diplomats working at consulates in the Chinese cities of Shenyang and Shanghai. The United States called these curbs \"unreasonable\" and countered by slapping new limits on personnel at the Chinese Consulate in Chicago. That sort of reciprocal nastiness would have been unthinkable 10 years ago. In the first place, the United States and China did not even have any diplomats living and working in the heartland of each other\u0027s territory. Second, both nations were eager to set aside all sources of conflict at the time to work together against the perceived Soviet threat. Wanted Strategic Partner \"The United States didn\u0027t have too much choice,\" said one West European diplomat who follows Chinese affairs. \"China was looking for a strategic partner against the Soviet Union. It found two countries who were willing to play the game: Japan and the United States.\" Although President Richard M. Nixon had moved to normalize ties with Beijing during his historic 1972 visit to China, neither he nor his successor, President Gerald R. Ford, was able to establish diplomatic relations with the Communist regime. They were never able to overcome the strong support for Taiwan\u0027s Nationalist regime in the right wing of the Republican Party. Consider, for example, the time then-Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) resorted to strong-arm tactics against Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. One day in May, 1976, Goldwater sent a private ultimatum to the Ford White House. He said he had heard a radio report that the Ford Administration was planning to establish diplomatic relations with \"Red China,\" either before or after the November elections. \u0027Don\u0027t Intend to Stay Quiet\u0027 \"It doesn\u0027t make any sense to me to forgo our friends on Taiwan and I don\u0027t intend to stay quiet about it, so please within 24 hours let me know what the truth is, and I mean the truth,\" Goldwater wrote. He threatened to withdraw political support for Ford, who was then being challenged by Reagan for the Republican presidential nomination. According to files at the Gerald R. Ford presidential library, Ford and Kissinger were forced to cave in. Within a day, Kissinger called Goldwater and gave him the assurances that were necessary to avoid a public dispute. It was left to Carter, a Democratic President, to take the political heat of recognizing China, and he, too, delayed doing so until soon after the 1978 congressional elections. When Carter finally made the public announcement, on Dec. 15, 1978, he was immediately savaged by conservative Republicans. Within a month, Reagan was not only criticizing Carter\u0027s recognition of Beijing, but also advocating \"continuation of government-to-government relations between the United States and Taiwan.\" Reagan Brought Testy Period Reagan\u0027s arrival in the White House precipitated a testy period in which China was unsure how much support the new President would give to Taiwan. The tension eased with a 1982 agreement limiting U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and, ultimately, with Reagan\u0027s own election-year visit to China in 1984. During that trip, the President minimized the ideological differences with China that had once preoccupied American conservatives by referring to China as a \"so-called Communist country.\" By the mid-1980s, the United States and China began to set aside -- or perhaps postpone for the future -- their disputes over Taiwan. The two countries even began to collaborate on a series of military exchanges, with Pentagon officials making regular visits to China and leaders of the Chinese People\u0027s Liberation Army touring military installations in the United States. But the two sides began to fight over other issues. China, sensitive to charges by Third World countries that it was aligning itself too closely with the United States, announced that it was conducting an \"independent\" foreign policy. The United States began to complain about China\u0027s arms sales overseas and to worry about China\u0027s continuing support for the murderous Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Trade and Students Whenever the two sides bicker, U.S. officials explain that ties with China remain strong. They point to the increasing trade between the two countries -- more than $13 billion this year -- and the high number of Chinese students, an estimated 32,000 to 40,000, being educated at American universities. One senior Reagan Administration official said last year that China and the United States now have a \"mature\" relationship, suggesting that the two countries are like a married couple, able to withstand a good fight once in a while. Some American scholars found such bland explanations irritating. \"If I hear one more State Department official talk about a \u0027mature relationship\u0027 with China, I\u0027m going to scream,\" said Robinson. \"It\u0027s as if the Chinese were juveniles before now.\" Indeed, although U.S. officials have gone to great lengths to stress the calm and continuity in Sino-American relations, the underlying American attitudes toward China have been changing in some significant ways during the last decade. Deng Toured U.S. Ten years ago, U.S. officials pinned their hopes for China\u0027s future largely on China\u0027s top political leadership. Within weeks after diplomatic relations were established in 1979, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made a triumphal tour of the United States. U.S. officials were effusive in their praise of Deng and the reform program he was beginning to launch in China. Now, Deng is 84, and some American officials and scholars have suggested privately that he is becoming arbitrary and erratic in his leadership, in much the same way as did Mao Tse-tung in the final years before his death in 1976. Last spring, for example, Deng seemed to call for a lifting of price controls and then to pull back in the face of a spurt of inflation. U.S. officials are also critical of some of the Chinese leaders who may succeed Deng. Speaking of Chinese Premier Li Peng, who was trained and educated in the Soviet Union, one Reagan Administration official said recently: \"Li Peng just doesn\u0027t understand how a market economy works. Things won\u0027t really move in China until after his years in power.\" These days, American hopes for China seem to rest not on its political elite, but on broader, long-range developments in Chinese society -- particularly the tens of thousands of young students being educated in the United States and the market-oriented economic reforms that are taking hold in China at the grass-roots. Divided Over Policy At the moment, there appear to be serious divisions among American policy-makers and scholars about how the United States should approach China in the next few years. Some American experts say that the United States should now base its ties to China primarily on economic cooperation and shift focus away from strategic factors such as joint opposition to the Soviet Union. \"The relationship (with China) from the beginning has been premised far too much on anti-Soviet factors,\" Lardy said. But one Reagan Administration official, who said that he personally agrees with this argument, acknowledged: \"There are still people in senior policy ranks in the United States who view China strictly in strategic terms.\" In a recent speech in San Francisco, U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord declared: \"Contrary to some fashionable pundits, I strongly believe strategic factors will remain crucial to our cooperation with China. . . . They are more muted and nuanced than before. But our two nations share a continuing stake in preserving global and regional balances.\" Ten years ago, at the time they established diplomatic relations, the United States and China were drawn together by their eagerness to join hands against the Soviet Union. Now, American scholars say, nothing between China and the United States is quite so easy. \"If people want a clear, compelling basis for U.S.-China relations these days, there just isn\u0027t going to be one,\" Harry Harding of the Brookings Institution said. \"Except that we are two big countries that are going to have to live with one another.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition GORBACHEV CALLS FOR \u0027GUMPTION\u0027 IN REFORM PUSH Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a televised New Year\u0027s address Saturday, called on the Soviet people to stop sitting on the sidelines and to show greater \"gumption\" in pursuing his policy of economic reform. Gorbachev acknowledged that perestroika, his program to restructure Soviet society, had raised high hopes among the citizens that had not yet been met. The 57-year-old Kremlin leader, who took office in March of 1985, blamed conservative forces in part for the slow pace of reform. But, using tough language, he also said that every Soviet citizen should do more to improve the quality of consumer goods and to end the shortages that have typified Soviet life since the 1930s. \u0027Greater Resoluteness\u0027 \"One cannot just outwit life and sit back on the sidelines,\" Gorbachev said. \"It is essential to act with greater resoluteness.\" He said his attempt to revamp Soviet society \"lends wings to real champions . . . and gives them added energies and gumption. And this is just what we need now most of all.\" His remarks seem to respond to critics who complained bitterly to him during a trip to Siberia in September of long -- and often unsuccessful -- waits to obtain basic consumer goods. Those dramatic encounters were carried on Soviet television, and Western analysts said the complaints helped to push Gorbachev to make major governmental changes in October, putting reform-minded supporters in positions of power. Gorbachev\u0027s year-end speech was broadcast across the country on Soviet television just minutes before midnight and was probably widely seen. New Year\u0027s Eve in the Soviet Union is a family holiday that traditionally includes the exchange of gifts and the viewing of special television programs until early morning hours. \"I do not want, and have no right, to paint a rosy overall picture,\" the Communist Party leader said in the broadcast. \"Perestroika gave rise to great expectations to society, but changes are not coming as fast as we would all like them to . . . . Demand still outstrips supply, especially when it comes to quality goods. \"This,\" he added, \"is explained in a large measure not only by the inertia of the past but also by the novelty of problems and the real difficulties of organizing life in a new way.\" Letters to officials have revealed Soviet concerns about how perestroika would affect individuals in the society where everyone is guaranteed a job and the state subsidizes everything from bread to apartments. In his address, Gorbachev warned that perestroika would mean greater individual responsibility. He said the changes would include more reliance on \"the pay-your-own-way system . . . and a broadened scope for initiatives and social enterprise.\" \u0027Have to Get in the Mood\u0027 \"We all have to get into the mood for such work,\" he added. On the topic of international relations, Gorbachev claimed that the Soviet Union, acting \"in the spirit of the new political thinking,\" was largely responsible for the thaw in the Cold War between East and West. The Soviets have learned to listen to the positions of other countries while still \"abiding by our own principles,\" he said. \"Of course, the shadows of the past are present in world politics,\" the Soviet leader added. \"But they are fading already. A new vision of the world is being established.\" On other subjects, Gorbachev referred briefly to the nationalist unrest that has torn parts of the Soviet Union. At least 31 people were killed in November in ethnic violence in the southwestern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. \"We are proceeding to another important phase of political reform, which will aim to harmonize inter-ethnic relations,\" he said. He also spoke of the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia, which the Soviet Union has said claimed tens of thousands of lives. \"The end of the year was darkened by anguish,\" he said. \"Our misfortune has evoked warmth, sympathy and response around the world.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition GORBACHEV AND REAGAN EXCHANGE HOLIDAY GREETINGS For the second consecutive year, President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev exchanged New Year\u0027s greetings for the Soviet and American people, each saluting the sharp improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations during 1988. The exchange of videotaped messages, each about five minutes long, for broadcast on Soviet and American television, reflected the new ease with which Reagan, who took office as perhaps the most anti-Communist leader in recent U.S. history, has been dealing with the Soviet Union in general and Gorbachev in particular. As if recognizing this, Gorbachev said in his remarks -- a text of which was made public Saturday by the White House -- that \"Americans seem to be rediscovering the Soviet Union -- and we are rediscovering America. Fears and suspicion are gradually giving way to trust and feelings of mutual liking. \"Last year was rich in momentous events. It also brought many good changes in relations between our peoples and countries,\" the Soviet leader added. \"Today they are more dynamic and more humane. We have become closer, and we have come to know each other better.\" Similarly, Reagan told the Soviet people, \"I am confident that relations between our two countries will continue on the positive course they have followed in the year just ending. \"Despite our disagreements, we have been able to find some common ground,\" he added, singling out human rights, arms control, regional problems and U.S.-Soviet relations in general. The Reagan-Gorbachev exchange was broadcast in full by ABC and NBC. CBS used excerpts from both talks on its evening news program. Difference From Last Year In tone and specific content, the speeches by the two leaders reflected the positive course in relations, when compared with the addresses each delivered one year ago. At that time, Reagan used the Soviet airwaves to gently prod the Kremlin on such sensitive issues as human rights and regional disputes, while giving a condensed introduction to American society that offered the Soviet audience a glimpse of American holiday traditions and a miniature civics lesson. And two years ago, Gorbachev declared that after the failures of the October, 1986, summit conference in Iceland, superpower relations were too poor to justify an exchange of New Year\u0027s greetings. So, Reagan\u0027s message that year, broadcast on the Voice of America, was blotted out by electronic jamming in much of the Soviet Bloc. Reagan\u0027s 1989 message was videotaped on Dec. 15 in the White House Map Room, before the President flew to California for a two-week vacation. The President said that in human rights, \"progress is being made in reunification of families, freedom of people to travel as they please, and in other areas.\" He also said that the halt in electronic jamming is a positive step. \u0027Solutions Being Found\u0027 \"In regional issues, from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf and southern Africa, solutions are being found to conflicts of many years\u0027 standing,\" Reagan said, challenging the Soviets to join \"in the effort to bring peace, democracy and security to Central America\" -- a region to which Gorbachev made no reference in his speech. Reagan also challenged the Soviets to go beyond the 500,000-troop cut in conventional forces that Gorbachev announced at the United Nations on Dec. 7. The troop reduction, Reagan said, is \"certainly a step in the right direction of correcting the imbalances in the European military situation.\" Administration Change Both the American and Soviet presidents, recognizing the change in administrations that is about to occur in the United States, predicted that President-elect George Bush would bring an element of continuity to the two nations\u0027 relations. \"We can look ahead with optimism to the future of our relations. This is what we talked about with President-elect Bush,\" Gorbachev said, referring to his meeting with Bush in New York on the day of the U.N. speech. Less Optimistic Approach In his weekly radio address broadcast in the United States, Reagan took a slightly less optimistic approach, stating that U.S.-Soviet relations can continue to improve, but \"we must remain sober in our estimation of our negotiating partners and without illusion . . . about their goals and aims.\" Whether seeking reduced tensions in relations with the Soviet Union or in the Middle East, the Bush Administration will need congressional support and \"appropriate levels of defense spending,\" Reagan said, adding, \"Trust me, I know.\" The radio address was delivered from the Palms Spring estate of Walter and Leonore Annenberg, with whom the President and Nancy Reagan are spending the New Year\u0027s holiday, as they have for nearly two decades. The festivities included a black-tie New Year\u0027s Eve dinner. \u0027Policy of Peace Paying Off\u0027 As the New Year arrived, the President declared in the radio speech that \"our economy is healthy, our defenses are strong and our policy of peace through strength is paying off in spades.\" Reagan\u0027s optimism was tempered only by the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 21. \"Now if, as seems likely, our terrorists have crawled out of their hole to threaten American lives, I can promise them this: The pledge we made to seek out the truth and punish the guilty is a sacred one which George Bush shares,\" he said.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition STATE HIGH COURT TAKES ANTICIPATED TURN TO THE RIGHT The widely anticipated turn to the right by the newly aligned California Supreme Court emerged in strikingly clear form in a range of decisions issued during 1988. In the past, under a liberal majority led by former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, business, insurers and law enforcement repeatedly suffered defeat. But last year, under a more conservative court led by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, yesterday\u0027s losers became today\u0027s consistent winners. The trend was underscored last week in the court\u0027s long-awaited ruling on wrongful discharge in which the justices limited the rights of workers to sue their employers for an unjust dismissal -- a decision with sweeping impact on a fast-growing area of employment law. The ruling followed the justices\u0027 far-reaching reversal last August of a 1979 landmark ruling that had allowed accident victims to bring damage suits against the wrongdoer\u0027s insurance company for the bad-faith refusal to accept a claim. Uphold Death Sentences On another front, the court, struggling to reduce a huge backlog of death penalty appeals, issued 56 capital rulings in 12 months, upholding death sentences 43 times. In the nine years ending in January, 1987, with the departure of Bird and two other justices defeated in the 1986 fall election, the court affirmed the death penalty only four times in 68 rulings. In other notable criminal law decisions last year, the court abandoned a past ruling that had restricted the use of improperly obtained confessions, opened the way for longer prison terms for repeat offenders and upheld a law aimed at curbing sex offenses by prohibiting loitering at public restrooms. Throughout the year, the justices showed little inclination to seek societal reform through ground-breaking court decisions -- a trademark of the court for the nearly three decades that it was under a liberal majority. The new court looked for guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court and courts in other states and expressed a desire to leave it to the Legislature to make bold changes in state law. Critics Disturbed The court\u0027s sharp turn disturbs critics who, while expecting some shift toward judicial conservatism, had hoped the change would not be so abrupt and wide-ranging. \"Since the Lucas court has taken over, we have had a series of decisions which operate to deprive individuals of their economic rights while benefiting large corporate institutions,\" said Steven J. Kaplan, a Los Angeles attorney who represented the employee who brought the wrongful-dismissal case decided last Thursday. \"This court, at a visceral level, is much more sympathetic to the corporate world than its predecessor,\" Kaplan said. Michael Laurence, director of a newly formed Death Penalty Project of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, raises concern over the record pace of capital case rulings and the court\u0027s tendency to uphold death verdicts even though a procedural error has occurred at trial. \"I am surprised that the court is not taking a closer look at some of these cases,\" Laurence said. \"This court is much more willing to find an error was harmless than was the previous court.\" But the beneficiaries of the shift on the court welcome what they see as a more balanced approach and a greater effort to clarify the law for judges, lawyers and litigants. \"This court has a fuller appreciation of what\u0027s involved in a criminal prosecution and a real-life grasp of how a case moves through the judicial system,\" said state Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Steve White. \"In both the criminal and civil area of the law, the court is more inclined to be sensible about the impact of a ruling on the judicial process,\" White said. \"It seems much more interested in supplying guidance to all parties so we can avoid error where possible.\" In an ironic twist, the court issued several rulings in 1988 that went against Gov. George Deukmejian, a leading critic of the Bird court who named the five justices to the seven-member court who formed a bloc that set a new philosophical course in the law. Taken by Surprise This apparent assertion of independence from the influence by the Republican governor took some observers by surprise. The justices ruled that Deukmejian\u0027s nominee for state treasurer, Rep. Daniel E. Lungren, could not take office with confirmation by only one house of the Legislature; held that a commission made up of Deukmejian appointees could not establish a \"sub-minimum\" wage for employees receiving tips, and twice refused to hear a Deukmejian Administration challenge to a 1981 Bird court ruling that struck down legislative restrictions on state-funded abortions for low-income women. Nonetheless, the results in a broad range of decisions issued during the last year signaled a marked change in direction from the old court. In significant criminal law rulings, the court: * Upheld three of every four death penalty verdicts it reviewed and, while issuing no particularly far-reaching decisions, made clear that it will not overturn death sentences because of a procedural error that, realistically, could not have affected the outcome of the case. * Ruled that prosecutors may use improperly obtained confessions to challenge the truthfulness of a defendant\u0027s testimony at trial. The justices, abandoning a 1976 ruling barring any such use of incriminating statements, said that under Proposition 8, the 1982 victims\u0027 bill-of-rights initiative, state courts now are bound by less-restrictive U.S. Supreme Court decisions on the issue. * Reversed a 1986 ruling by the old court and held that trial judges may review a wider range of court records to determine whether convicted felons may be sentenced to longer prison terms because of previous commission of a residential burglary. * Held that the state Board of Prison Terms properly rescinded the impending parole of \"Onion Field\" killer Gregory Ulas Powell based on new evidence that his release could endanger public safety. The decision overturned a contrary ruling by the Bird court in 1986 that had opened the way for the release of the convicted murderer of a Los Angeles police officer in 1963. * Reversing another decision under Bird, held that trial judges need not warn jurors that eyewitness identifications of suspected criminals may be unreliable and should be viewed with caution. The debate over the reliability of such identifications should be left to trial counsel and expert witnesses to argue before the jury, the justices said. * Upheld the constitutionality of a state law making it a crime to loiter near a public restroom. The court rejected arguments by civil libertarians that the law would encourage discriminatory arrests against homosexuals. * Allowed the prosecution for manslaughter of a Christian Scientist parent whose child died after her mother rejected medical assistance in favor of an attempt to heal by prayer. Parents, the court said, have no right to exercise religious beliefs at the price of a child\u0027s life. In major civil decisions, the court: * Ruling in the milestone case of Los Angeles executive Daniel D. Foley, held that an employee who is fired without good cause, in violation of a company promise, can sue his employer only for lost pay and other economic loss. Awards for emotional distress and punitive damages, which could range into hundreds of thousands of dollars, may not be obtained, the justices said. More than 1,000 wrongful discharge suits are filed annually in the state. Attorneys predicted a sharp drop in such litigation because dismissed workers will have less incentive to file suit and attorneys, working on a contingency-fee basis, will be less willing to take on cases. * Overturned a major ruling by the Bird court and held that accident victims may not bring suit under state insurance law for the insurer\u0027s refusal to fairly settle a claim. The court noted that the previous ruling had been widely criticized and rejected by most other states that had considered it. In California, the justices said, the ruling had produced confusion, inequitable results and high litigation costs. * Turned down a challenge by state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to the $10.1-billion purchase of Getty Oil by Texaco in 1984, ruling that state antitrust law cannot be used to attack mergers by corporations. * Upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 51, the \"deep-pockets\" liability-reform initiative limiting damages for pain and suffering and other non-economic injury in civil injury cases. However, the court, limiting the immediate impact of the measure, ruled it will not apply to tens of thousands of cases that were pending when it was passed by the voters in 1986. * Gave broad protection to prescription drug makers by holding that injured consumers cannot collect damages unless they prove that firms were negligent in making the drugs or in failing to warn of their potential dangers. In another victory for manufacturers, the court also held that cancer victims are not entitled to damages for injury from the drug DES unless they filed suit within a year after they first suspected harm from the substance. * In a case watched closely by religious groups, ruled in a milestone \"clergy malpractice\" suit that church pastors may not be held liable for the suicide of a despondent youth to whom they had given spiritual counseling. * Said that the Rev. Sun Myung Moon\u0027s Unification Church can be sued for fraud for allegedly \"brainwashing\" unknowing recruits and tricking them into joining the church. * Barred a single man from suing for the negligence-related death of his live-in girlfriend, ruling that unmarried cohabitants are not entitled to the same rights that the law gives married couples to bring such suits.",

STUDYING ANTITRUST ISSUES; MIAMI NEWS, CITY\u0027S OLDEST DAILY, CLOSES Staff members of the Miami News bid \"Farewell, Miami\" with their final banner headline and a newsroom champagne toast Saturday morning as Miami\u0027s oldest daily -- older than the city itself -- shut down. \"It\u0027s over,\" said Howard Kleinberg, the News\u0027 editor and an employee for 38 years. \"I think we gave it a good effort.\" \"This isn\u0027t just another newspaper dying. It has a rich and proud history,\" Publisher David Kraslow said. \"Our influence far exceeded our circulation.\" Circulation Declines The circulation of the crusading newspaper, winner of five Pulitzer Prizes, had declined 57% in a little more than two decades to about 48,000. The owner, Cox Enterprises Inc. of Atlanta, said it was unable to sell the News and was losing about $28,500 a day. The Justice Department has said its antitrust division will look at the closing and whether Cox made a serious effort to sell the newspaper. But a federal judge Friday denied a private coalition\u0027s effort to get an injunction against the closing. The only apparent way to give the News a reprieve would be a Justice Department injunction. Cox announced in October that the newspaper would be closed Dec. 31 if it was not sold. Under a recent amendment to a 1966 joint operating agreement with the Miami Herald, Cox would have become responsible in 1990 for the News\u0027 operating losses. But Cox will continue to share in profits of the Herald, a Knight-Ridder newspaper with a circulation of more than 400,000, through 2021 even with the News closed. Cox will earn an estimated $300 million through the agreement, the News reported Saturday. Affects News Staff The news staff, which numbered about 105 in recent weeks, is the main staff affected by the shutdown, since the business operation is shared with the Herald\u0027s. The News was born May 15, 1896, two months before the city was incorporated, as the Miami Metropolis. It lost some readers in the 1960s with its early, vigorous criticism of the Vietnam War. Even with its employees job-hunting, the News broke several stories in its final days and was in the lead in reporting the Justice Department investigation and criticism of its own parent company. \"It was a damn good newspaper,\" said columnist Mort Lucoff, 59, cleaning out his desk after 25 years at the newspaper. \"It\u0027s pretty wrenching. I put a quarter-century of life into this newspaper.\"",

The blast, which occurred at about 3:10 a.m., blew doors and windows out of the garage and hurled one of the youths into the driveway of the home rented by Vera Machado, the legal counselor for the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, police said. They said Machado and her husband, Ronald, were asleep in an upstairs bedroom at the time of the blast and were not injured. One of the dead youths was identified as Gustavo Machado, 15, the couple\u0027s son. The others were identified as Samir Gafsi, Dov Fischman and Bruno Perrone, all either 17 or 18 years old and all college freshmen. The three older teen-agers were described Saturday as highly intelligent, science-oriented 1988 graduates of Bethesda\u0027s Walt Whitman High School. One of them, Gafsi, showed a recent interest in explosives, according to his girlfriend, Sharmi Banik. \"He was telling me about the explosion on the Pan Am jet\" that crashed in Scotland on Dec. 21 after a bomb went off, Banik said Saturday. She said Gafsi recently told her that he and his friends could \"do better than that.\" Montgomery County Police Sgt. Harry Geehreng said the blast was not caused by terrorists and appeared to be an accident. He said there was no indication the victims had been drinking or using drugs. He said the explosion damaged a car in the garage but there was no evidence that a bomb had been placed in or under the vehicle. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is investigating the explosion, officials said. Officials want to know how the device was made as well as \"why was the device made,\" Geehreng said. \"This device was much more than ordinary fireworks.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition HIGH COURT SPOILED BID TO SOLVE BISHOP\u0027S MURDER, SALVADORANS SAY Officials in the Salvadoran government say that the 1980 assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, which helped spark the nation\u0027s civil war and caused worldwide outrage, will remain unresolved because of a Supreme Court ruling that the testimony of a key witness is not valid. The ruling, handed down Dec. 21, has caused an uproar in El Salvador, escalating the already heated presidential campaign rhetoric between the Christian Democrats of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), the main opposition party. \"In fact, the case is now closed and justice has been mocked,\" said Roberto Giron Flores, who, as attorney general, was investigating the case until he was fired Dec. 23 by the Arena-controlled National Assembly. U.S. officials, who invested much time and effort in the case, were outraged by the ruling and are making that displeasure known, but diplomatic and political sources say the Americans acknowledge that nothing can be done to revive the case. Romero, a charismatic, outspoken opponent of rightist death squads and military repression, was killed by a single shot through the heart on March 24, 1980, while saying Mass. It was the most publicized killing of thousands carried out by the death squads, and Duarte had vowed to punish those responsible. Former U.S. Ambassador Robert E. White asserted that the killing was ordered by Roberto d\u0027Aubuisson, a founder of Arena and currently a legislator in the National Assembly. D\u0027Aubuisson has denied the allegation. In November, 1987, Duarte made public testimony given to investigators by Amado Garay, identified as the driver of the getaway car in the killing. Garay said that he worked for Alvaro Saravia, a cashiered Salvadoran air force captain and protege of D\u0027Aubuisson. Garay said that after the killing, Saravia reported on the success of the operation to D\u0027Aubuisson. D\u0027Aubuisson declared at the time that Garay was lying and rejected the allegations. Based on Garay\u0027s testimony, after he passed numerous lie-detector tests and other elements of his testimony were investigated, the Salvadoran government, with U.S. help, asked for Saravia\u0027s extradition from Miami, where he was living illegally. Saravia was arrested in Miami for violating the terms of his visa, and has been held since, as the extradition request proceeded. He was to have been extradited in early January, according to legal sources. But the Salvadoran Supreme Court, described by knowledgeable diplomats and Christian Democrats as dominated by the far right, ruled Dec. 21 that there were no grounds for arresting Saravia if he returned to El Salvador and that the extradition request itself was illegal. The court ruled that delay in presentation of Garay\u0027s evidence, after \"seven years, seven months and 24 days, completely undermines the credibility of his testimony\" and resulted in no evidence linking Saravia to the killing. \"The problem here is that we have to understand the judicial system has been totally dominated by Arena, which blocks the investigation and application of justice,\" said Antonio Morales Erlich, secretary general of the Christian Democrats. \"I want to say as a lawyer that the witness and evidence presented in the Romero case were ample to proceed with an arrest order.\" On Dec. 23, the assembly, in its last session of the year and with only the Arena deputies supporting the move, fired Giron Flores as attorney general, alleging \"incompetence and immorality,\" and named Arena sympathizer Roberto Garcia Alvarado to replace him. \"The truth is that I was fired for a simple and fundamental reason -- because the Romero case was about to be resolved,\" Giron Flores said. \"Saravia was about to return and we were going to discover who was responsible. . . . The Romero case is now closed, and I was fired so the case could be closed.\" Knowledgeable observers say that Giron Flores is correct, because, by ruling that the testimony was too old -- although no Salvadoran law places time limits on the validity of testimony -- any new evidence or testimony will be thrown out on the same grounds. \"On legal and procedural grounds, the case is dead,\" said one person familiar with the case. Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, after a Mass on Christmas Day, said, \"In the church, we think (Saravia) has valuable information on this act which convulsed the country.\" Arena\u0027s presidential candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, said that Giron Flores was fired for \"demonstrable reasons showing he was not fit to continue in office,\" and Cristiani accused the Christian Democrats of throwing up a \"smoke screen\" and \"politicizing\" the matter by trying to link the firing to the Romero case. The investigation into Romero\u0027s killing was being handled by a special investigative unit that had received U.S. training. According to two people involved in the investigation, Saravia was also to be charged upon his return here with the kidnaping and murder in 1985 of Carlos Guerra Campos, a wealthy coffee grower. Investigators said that they planned to use the Guerra Campos case to force Saravia to give evidence in the Romero case. \"It was to be our checkmate move,\" one investigator said. Investigators also said that Garay had identified Dr. Hector Antonio Regalado, a dentist, as the triggerman in the murder, although they said that there was no hard evidence other than Garay\u0027s statement linking him to the shooting. Regalado, an expert marksman, was head of security at the Constituent Assembly when D\u0027Aubuisson was president of that body in the early 1980s. Earlier this year, two men who worked in the assembly at that time said that Regalado ran right-wing death squads from the building.",

Following criticism from parliamentary deputies and other radicals that formation of the 13-member High Council of Expedience was unconstitutional, Khomeini declared that it will no longer be allowed to legislate independently of the Majlis, or Parliament. The official radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini, Iran\u0027s supreme leader, urged a return to constitutional law now that the need for a speedy decision-making process has decreased since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war with Iraq. Khomeini, who set up the council in February, said it should revert to its original role -- settling disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians, a panel of clergyman empowered to block laws they consider un-Islamic. \"No problem is (now) so urgent as to be debated directly in that council without being debated in the Majlis and being supervised by the Council of Guardians,\" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying. The new decree takes effect Jan. 21. The High Council of Expedience was founded to stop ideological arguments about the limits of government power from blocking important legislation. It was also authorized to issue decrees on urgent matters.",

Salo politely asked if he could be of any help to the old man. It turned out to be the other way around. O\u0027Toole opened his Pan Am flight bag, and Salo found himself staring at a bundle of bonds -- $50,000 worth. \"I want Planned Parenthood to have this money,\" O\u0027Toole said. And so began a strange, 11-year acquaintanceship between Salo and the mysterious visitor, who died recently at the age of 91 and left the Planned Parenthood affiliate his life\u0027s fortune of nearly $200,000. \"He told me that he had been an unwanted child who had been left by his mother,\" Salo said. \"He never went into details, but it seemed to bother him terribly that he had been abandoned. He didn\u0027t want that to happen to any other child.\" At O\u0027Toole\u0027s request, Salo said, the money will be used for education programs that stress family planning and services such as prenatal care, birth control, sterilization and abortion. \"Mr. O\u0027Toole was perfectly lucid,\" Salo said. \"He said things in a straightforward way, and told us that this is what he wanted to do.\" The bequest followed an agreement reached by the two men at the first meeting on July 7, 1977. Salo hesitated in accepting the initial gift of bonds, suggesting that O\u0027Toole instead put the money in a trust that would pay him interest. Then, if O\u0027Toole still wanted Planned Parenthood to have his fortune, Salo told him, the organization would graciously accept it upon his death. O\u0027Toole then created a trust fund with $70,000 in bonds and a life insurance policy. Salo never did learn much about the enigmatic O\u0027Toole, who never married and had no children. The two men rarely met, and during the last year Salo had heard nothing from him. \"He came into my office maybe a total of six or seven times,\" Salo said. \"He never wanted anything back. I would say, \u0027Hello, Mr. O\u0027Toole, how are you today?\u0027 There was some small talk, and then he left. He was a nice old man.\" \"In all the time I knew him, I think we spent less than three hours together,\" Salo said. \"He never wanted to take up much of my time.\" In early December, Salo received a note from San Diego Trust \u0026 Savings. Edward O\u0027Toole had died Nov. 15, 1988, the note said, and Planned Parenthood was the sole beneficiary of his trust. Bank officials say the account is worth nearly $200,000. \"It\u0027s a shame that we don\u0027t know more about this man,\" Salo said. \"All I know is that he had a very unhappy childhood. He wanted people to really think about having children.\"",

In the first incident, at 7 p.m. Friday, Lorenzo Ruelas, 35, of Oxnard was killed when he was hit by an Amtrak passenger train traveling 70 m.p.h. outside Oxnard, Ventura County Sheriff\u0027s Sgt. Carl Schoenberger said. It has not been determined why Ruelas was walking on the tracks. Two hours later Shawn James Schultz, 21, of Escondido was playing the daredevil game \"chicken\" with friends when he put his head on the tracks and was struck and killed by a southbound Amtrak train in Oceanside, Officer Lori Conway said. The Amtrak train bound for San Diego from Los Angeles was traveling about 30 m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. as it moved through the city about 40 miles north of San Diego, said Police Sgt. Richard Derouen. The friends did nothing as the engine ran over Shultz because \"the object of the game is to see how long you can stay down,\" Derouen explained. At 3 a.m. Saturday a heavily tattooed man lying on railroad tracks in Sun Valley was run over by a freight train and killed, authorities said. The train\u0027s crew told officers they saw the man as the locomotive approached but were unable to stop in time, Sgt. William Meier said. The victim, who was carrying no identification papers, had not been identified by late Saturday. At 6 a.m. Saturday, a woman walking to work was struck and killed by a freight train as she stumbled and fell across tracks in El Monte, Sgt. Steve Schuster said. Mary Louise Johnson, 30, of Temple City was pronounced dead at the scene, Schuster said. Johnson was carrying a small bag containing her lunch when she stumbled while walking across a triple-track area. She was hit when she reached to pick up the contents of the bag, he said. \"It was still dark at the time,\" Schuster said. He speculated that she misjudged the speed of the train.",

State Appellate Division attorneys filed a request Friday that the Oregon Supreme Court block a Dec. 7 order by Clackamas County Judge John Lowe giving defense attorneys access to children taken from the group\u0027s rural Oregon camp. Four adult Ecclesia members face trial Feb. 6 in Clackamas County in the Oct. 14 beating death of Dayna Broussard, the 8-year-old daughter of the Los Angeles-based group\u0027s founder, Eldridge Broussard Jr. Defense attorneys for Willie Chambers, 35; Brian Brinson, 30; Frederick Doolittle, 28, and Constance Jackson, 37, have sought to interview some of the 53 children taken into state protective custody at the group\u0027s farmhouse near Sandy, east of Portland, hours after the girl\u0027s death. The group originally organized the farm near Sandy as an athletic training center to train inner-city youths from Los Angeles. However, state officials have alleged that the children were subject to ritualistic abuse, some beaten hundreds of times while the others were forced to keep count. The state attorneys were in a race with the clock in trying to block interviews with the children as Clackamas County prosecutors have been ordered to appear in Circuit Court next Tuesday to show why they should not be held in contempt of court for failing to produce the children. Defense attorneys Wednesday were granted their request for the order after attempts to set up interviews with the children were stalled while prosecutors waited to see if the Justice Department would review the matter. Virginia Linder, solicitor general for the state Justice Department, said the Supreme Court previously has ruled against trial court judges in criminal proceedings ordering the Children\u0027s Services Division to produce children in its custody for defense interviews or parents to produce children for the same reason. The question still undecided by the court is whether such judges can order prosecutors to produce a child for interviews when the child is in state custody, as in the Ecclesia case.",

Blaisdell Jr., whose half-century of public service and scholarship included a prominent role in planning the reconstruction of postwar Europe, died Tuesday. He was 93. Blaisdell was a distinguished professor of political science at UC Berkeley who continued teaching long after assuming emeritus status in 1963. After a long career in public service starting in the New Deal era and culminating in his leadership in helping plan European recovery after World War II, Blaisdell joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1951. Active in publishing and lecturing well into retirement, Blaisdell taught freshman seminars in political science and international relations as recently as last year. Born in 1895 in Pittsburgh, Pa., Blaisdell graduated from Pennsylvania State College in 1916. He earned a master\u0027s degree in social history at Columbia University in 1922 and his doctorate there in 1932. He taught at Columbia from 1925 to 1932. In 1933, Blaisdell went to Washington to join Franklin D. Roosevelt\u0027s \"brain trust\" in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Over the next two decades, he held a number of federal positions, working first on helping the nation recover from the Depression and then on European postwar reconstruction. Blaisdell was assistant secretary of commerce during the Administration of President Harry S. Truman. Although he was modest about his role in postwar European recovery, colleagues have called him one of the principal architects of the Marshall Plan, proclaimed in 1947 by Secretary of State George C. Marshall. A widely published author, Blaisdell\u0027s best known work was \"The American Presidency in Political Cartoons.\" Written with Peter Selz, a Berkeley art history professor, the 1976 book received wide acclaim. No services have been set. The family asked that donations be sent to the Fund for Cal in the Capital, the Young Musicians Program, both at UC Berkeley, or the Harry S.

Larisa Bogoraz, a veteran of the Soviet dissident movement who was Daniel\u0027s wife when he was sentenced to five years in prison and labor camp, said he died of a stroke. Daniel was 63 and had been in ill health for years. Daniel\u0027s most famous work, \"This is Moscow Calling,\" satirically called for a \"Public Murder Day,\" in which Soviets over the age of 16 would be allowed to kill someone as long as it was not a policeman or a public transport worker. Published Under Glasnost Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev\u0027s policy of glasnost, or greater openness, some of Daniel\u0027s works written in prison camp were published in Moscow in July as he lay in a hospital. Daniel and Sinyavsky, conscious of the ostracism of Nobel Prize-winning author Boris Pasternak for publishing his novel \"Doctor Zhivago\" abroad, used the pseudonyms Nikolai Arzhak and Abram Terts, respectively, to publish their works abroad. Despite persecution of writers such as Pasternak, Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev\u0027s years were relatively free for writers, and came to be known as \"The Thaw.\" But Daniel and Sinyavsky were arrested in the autumn of 1965, less than a year after Khrushchev was ousted by a group of Kremlin leaders from which Leonid I. Brezhnev eventually would emerge as the most powerful. Daniel received a five-year term in prison and labor camp for illegally publishing his works abroad, and Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years. It was the first time that criminal charges were brought against Soviet intellectuals for literary criticism of the Soviet system. Dissidents, KGB agents and foreign correspondents huddled outside the Moscow courtroom where they were tried, and rushed to get word of the proceedings when the defendants\u0027 wives would come out during breaks. News of the trial was broadcast back into the Soviet Union by foreign radio stations. The Kremlin followed their trial with a long and determined crackdown on dissidents and unofficial publications, but during the late 1960s unofficial publications and the number of dissidents grew nevertheless. Ended Dissident Activities Daniel lived and worked in Kaluga and Moscow after he finished his prison term, but did not take part in further dissident activities. Sinyavsky emigrated to Paris after serving his term. The publication Ogonyok, in printing Daniel\u0027s prison camp poetry, called him a \"war veteran and man of difficult fate.\" Included in the poems published in July was \"The Ring,\" in which Daniel appeared to be describing his trial as a boxing match. Bogoraz said that Daniel was survived by his wife, Irina Uvarova, a son and grandson.",

Four educated, ambitious, politically savvy men -- they were the first group to take their seats together as newcomers since 1977. They were instantly nicknamed The Four Freshmen, and they almost as quickly predicted that they could become a force on the nine-member council. \"We\u0027re going into office as a coalition of sorts,\" District 8 Councilman Bob Filner said the day after he was elected with the 2nd District\u0027s Ron Roberts, 4th District\u0027s Wes Pratt and 6th District\u0027s Bruce Henderson. \"People may wonder how or where the mayor and the current council members might get votes from us. But, on the other hand, with four of us coming in, we only need to pick up one vote to do what we want to.\" As Filner could best attest, it has not worked out that way. The freshmen\u0027s political differences soon dashed any semblance of a coalition forged in the heat of the campaign, and their fortunes have followed divergent paths. But each began to carve a niche for himself as the council fought and lost the battle to rein in growth, confirmed a new police chief, selected a site for a new Civic Center, grappled with an expensive sewage problem, authorized yet another study of how to relocate the airport, endorsed Mayor Maureen O\u0027Connor\u0027s Soviet arts festival and raised hotel taxes to pay for it. Here is a look, in district order, at the Four Freshmen\u0027s first two semesters. The day after he was elected, District 2 Councilman, Ron Roberts promised to \"hit the ground running.\" These days, it is said around City Hall, Roberts is running -- for mayor. A Friend to All Issues Roberts, whose district stretches from Point Loma to Mission Hills, greets returning warships, fires starter\u0027s pistols at track meets, cuts ribbons, accepts awards and gives speeches. His energy is so boundless, his presence so ubiquitous, his name in the news so often, that it is difficult to remember he has been on council only a year. Roberts has yet to meet an issue he doesn\u0027t like. Whether it is growth management, safety and noise at Lindbergh Field or sewage treatment and water reclamation, Roberts has studied it, and he has a plan for improving it. More than any of the four new council members -- perhaps more than any other council member except Gloria McColl -- Roberts has nimbly stepped into the power vacuum created by the city\u0027s weak mayor form of government and O\u0027Connor\u0027s hands-off leadership style. Mixed Reviews At year\u0027s end, he had positioned himself in a tenuous coalition of five moderate-to-conservative Republicans that could dominate the nine-member council if its members can overcome longstanding differences among them. At the same time, he remains close to O\u0027Connor, who endorsed only him among the eight candidates in the 1987 election. Some of Roberts\u0027 adventures have backfired. An attempt to remove the city\u0027s highly successful Motion Picture and Television Bureau from the Chamber of Commerce led to an embarrassing defeat and ill will from the chamber. \"I would do that differently if I had it all to do over again,\" he said. Slow-growth activists, who had high hopes for Roberts when O\u0027Connor endorsed him as \"someone who knows how to say \u0027no\u0027 to developers,\" now consider him the architect of some of Proposition H\u0027s worst features. \"Ron Roberts talks like Mr. Rogers but votes like Attila the Hun,\" was a standard campaign stump line from Citizens for Limited Growth\u0027s Peter Navarro. Roberts deftly handles speculation about his ambition. \"The things I\u0027m doing are because that\u0027s how I interpret the job of being on the council. If there is, at a later date, a reward in citizens saying, \u0027We\u0027re willing to to let you step up to a higher office,\u0027 that\u0027s fine.\" O\u0027Connor, who this month began a new four-year term in office, has heard the whispers about Roberts\u0027 ambition but is unconcerned. \"I have to tell you, I think they\u0027re all running for mayor. Everybody\u0027s running for mayor. Secretly, and I\u0027ll talk generically, any council member who serves as a council member has kind of a little, secret desire to one day be mayor,\" she said. \"My philosophy is \u0027good government is good politics,\u0027 \" she added, \"I work hard, I try to serve the community well. It\u0027s their choice. What will be will be.\" High-Profile Concerns Blessed with intelligence, drive and an All-American, good-guy personality, Roberts has benefited from the fact that the issues he is best able to tackle are among the city\u0027s most high-profile concerns. Roberts\u0027 district includes Lindbergh Field, so he is a natural to work on the pressing matters of noise and safety at the airport -- issues watched closely throughout the region. Point Loma is home to the city\u0027s only sewage treatment plant, so Roberts has become outspoken on the city\u0027s need for a $1.5-billion upgrading of its sewer-treatment system, and, more specifically, on the need to develop water reclamation technology. As an architect and former chairman of the Planning Commission, Roberts was installed as chairman of the committee that wrote Proposition H, the council\u0027s growth-management plan. He became the leading spokesman for it during the unsuccessful election campaign. But Roberts\u0027 success is mostly of his own making. He worked with Point Loma residents and the Port District to fashion the compromise plan approved this month that will limit noise from takeoffs and landings at Lindbergh. He has ridden in an airplane cockpit to assess the danger, if any, posed by the Laurel Travel Center building at the foot of the airport runway. He is involved in discussions with the Navy to reshape the landscape at the foot of Broadway. Somehow, Roberts finds time for his district. He has worked to revitalize Ocean Beach and is helping Point Loma\u0027s planning board devise ways to lessen peak-hour traffic, caused largely by sailors, on Catalina Boulevard and Rosecrans Street. \"That man is working day and night,\" said Ann Jackson, chairman of the Peninsula Community Planning Board. \"I feel very fortunate that he chose to leave the architectural profession and try serving the city and the community. He\u0027s doing a wonderful job.\" Roberts points to a new downtown plan, a new waterfront plan, the growth-control debate and the airport as his major issues in 1989. He also will be heavily involved in the council\u0027s redistricting efforts and is rumored to want to add a chunk of downtown to his district. Wes Pratt took office, took one look at the crying needs in his impoverished council district and took to the streets of Southeast San Diego. He lectures schoolchildren on the evils of drugs, marches to protest gang violence and goes door-to-door exhorting homeowners in the battle against crack dealers. Long before district elections were approved by voters in the November, Pratt, the council\u0027s lone black member, focused his energy on the concerns of his largely minority constituents in the 4th District, which includes Southeast San Diego, Encanto, Paradise Hills and most of the California 94 corridor. If that meant that his colleagues would grab the limelight, so be it. \"I decided I would simply concentrate on district-related issues and getting out into the district,\" he said. His record is true to that decision. In his first year, Pratt sought more money for social services to AIDS victims, a growing concern of the minority community. He championed the losing Charter Review Commission ballot initiative for a tough police review board and was critical of the police shooting of Tommie Dubose during an arrest. He was actively involved in the negotiations to sell Southeast\u0027s San Diego Physicians \u0026 Surgeons Hospital, and at year\u0027s end was leading the effort to have the city\u0027s Convention Center named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader Staying Above the Fray Pratt has developed a reputation for staying above the fray on City Hall\u0027s 10th floor, where the deal-cutting and alliance-building among council members can be fast-paced. That stance has allowed Pratt to acquire some power as a somewhat unpredictable swing vote on the nine-member council. It was Pratt, for example, who came back from his sickbed to break a 4-4 tie on the size of the increase of the city\u0027s hotel room tax. \"I didn\u0027t ask to be in that position,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just the way I conduct myself in the City Council is to be pretty straightforward and not ally myself with one faction or another.\" Herb Cawthorne, executive director of the San Diego Urban League, believes Pratt \"has done an exceptional job. He\u0027s surprised a lot of people with his ability to grasp the larger issues. He has a tremendous amount of pressure on him, because his balance makes him the swing factor a lot of times. \"I think, as he matures, he will learn to exercise the power in more far-reaching ways,\" Cawthorne added. George Stevens, an aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Pratt\u0027s opponent in the council race, praises Pratt for his stand on the police review issue and for his responsiveness to neighborhood needs. But Stevens believes that Pratt should be supporting a committee recommendation to include King\u0027s full name in the convention center title instead of Pratt\u0027s proposal of \"San Diego King Convention Center.\" And he believes Pratt should have gotten an even larger share of this year\u0027s Community Development block grant money than the $2 million his district received. A rare politician who does not feel the need to give extended speeches before each vote, the quiet, burly Pratt has earned the respect of colleagues with his allegiance to doing what is right. \"Wes Pratts don\u0027t come along very often,\" said Mayor Maureen O\u0027Connor. \"He\u0027s got a rare quality about him.\" And \"99% of the time he\u0027s on the side of the angels,\" she added. \"I basically want to be about the business of good government,\" Pratt said. \"I will continue to do that. I don\u0027t feel I have to wave a big flag. Wes Pratt is not going to be here forever. People have to take up the mantle and serve.\" Bruce Henderson has taken a prominent role in some important citywide and district issues. Henderson was the architect of Proposition K, the advisory ballot measure calling for a mandatory, citywide program of staggered work hours to reduce peak-hour traffic congestion. Along with several other council members, he has championed an ordinance to preserve single-family neighborhoods, which make up a sizable part of his 6th District, which includes Pacific Beach, Mission Beach and Clairemont. He led the fight to equip the city\u0027s police force with two helicopters captured from drug runners. One chopper is now operating and the other is being outfitted. Henderson continues to be the council\u0027s maverick on its $1.5-billion sewer system upgrade, insisting that the effort is not necessary. He also led opposition to a $1.5-million consulting contract to publicize the issue, narrowly losing his effort to sharply reduce the program, but managing to pare $300,000 from the price tag. Despite that sizable first-year agenda, Henderson is best known inside City Hall for the publicity stunts, his long, sometimes unfocused speeches and his class-clown tendency to interrupt colleagues during council sessions. Blowup Sharks, Posters Henderson has filled the council chamber with the ominous background music from the film \"Jaws\" and adorned the room with inflatable sharks to make his point that \"consultant sharks\" are feeding on public tax dollars. He altered a \"Jaws\" poster to show the shark munching a dollar bill. His \"Fly Me\" poster focused attention on the helicopters. He handed out a commuter survival kit at a press conference to exhort voters to approve Proposition K. Henderson has \"a sense of humor, a different way of doing things,\" said O\u0027Connor, who concedes she has at times become exasperated trying to silence Henderson at council meetings. \"He has fun and doesn\u0027t take it personally. . . . He does make you laugh. \"He tries to exaggerate to make his point. And, through his exaggerations, he makes his points. That\u0027s his way of doing it.\" Henderson agrees that he\u0027s trying \"just to have a little fun\" during council meetings that can stretch eight hours or more. \"The sharks captured the council\u0027s attention,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t win, but at least I saved the city $300,000.\" Admits to \u0027Fine Line\u0027 But, he acknowledges, \"I have to be careful because there\u0027s a fine line between using them and amusing (council members) and over-using them and irritating (council members).\" Behind the clowning, council members agree, is a keen mind and a financial acumen that many other council members lack. Henderson has also concentrated on his district, focusing on a traffic study of Mission Bay, Pacific Beach and La Jolla and closely scrutinizing requests for exemptions from the city\u0027s Interim Development Ordinance in his neighborhoods. He has also maneuvered himself into the chairmanship of the Public Facilities and Recreation Committee, where he will have a more direct impact on Mission Bay Park. Henderson was perhaps the council\u0027s most outspoken opponent of the growth-management plan, though he did vote for it after weeks of negotiation. \"I didn\u0027t like H . . ., \" he said of Proposition H. \"I was very pleased by the voters, that they rejected it.\" Henderson called the voters\u0027 decision \"a reaffirmation of representative democracy,\" because it put the future of growth management back in the council\u0027s hands. Henderson, \"I think, has been less of an environmental supporter than we had expected,\" said Barbara Bamberger, the Sierra Club\u0027s conservation coordinator. \"And we didn\u0027t expect much.\" This has not been Bob Filner\u0027s month. It started Nov. 29 when a coalition of five council members relieved him of $1.7 million in Community Development block grant funds that City Manager John Lockwood had recommended for his 8th District. The following day, the same group turned down O\u0027Connor\u0027s suggestion that Filner head a council committee and installed Henderson as chairman instead. A week later, they were at it again, refusing to allow Filner to represent the council on the Metropolitan Transit Development Board. Filner\u0027s colleagues say they were trying to teach him a lesson. They say he is abrasive, that he takes political and philosophical debate and raises it to the level of personal attack. \"Bob tends to personalize it: \u0027you\u0027re evil, you\u0027re bad, you\u0027re mean, you\u0027ve broken the law, and I don\u0027t like you, and I\u0027m going to take my football and go home,\u0027 \" Henderson said. Roberts, one of the group of moderate-to-conservative Republicans who engineered Filner\u0027s thrashing, claims he was motivated by Filner\u0027s attempt, during back-corridor wrangling over committee chairmanships, to put together a slate that would have left Roberts without a chairmanship. Convenient Target? Filner remains defiant, claiming that the group he has dubbed \"the Gang of Five\" was motivated by common ideological and political goals, not personal ones. As perhaps the council\u0027s most liberal member, Filner believes he makes a convenient target. \"The defeat of the H and J has emboldened the pro-development forces on the council,\" he said, referring to council members Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson, Judy McCarty, Ed Struiksma and Gloria McColl. \"I think that\u0027s what is behind some of the recent votes with the Gang of Five. \"There\u0027s an ideological, partisan effort to make sure I am kept weak,\" he said. He does not deny trying to put together a slate of committee chairmen without Roberts on it. \"Why is my attempting to put together a slate that\u0027s helpful to me any worse or better than his trying to put together a slate that\u0027s beneficial to him?,\" he asked. The answer is that Roberts had the votes to win and Filner didn\u0027t. Votes are the bottom line, said Andrea Skorepa, executive director of a San Ysidro social service agency and a Filner antagonist who supported his opponent, Mike Aguirre, in the most recent election. \"I think, for our community, he hasn\u0027t been as effective a representative as he could be,\" she said. Earlier in the year, Filner watched helplessly as the council overruled his recommendation and gave a publicly run recreation center in his district to Skorepa\u0027s organization. The internal conflict has overshadowed Filner\u0027s accomplishments in his large, meandering district, which stretches from Hillcrest through downtown and includes San Ysidro and Otay Mesa. A fanatical worker, he is perhaps the council\u0027s most cerebral member, who has a tendency to intellectual honesty even if his views are not politically popular. He is on leave from San Diego State University, where he teaches history. Variety of Concerns Filner was the only council member to oppose placing Charter Commission initiatives directly on the ballot without review, arguing that the position was an abdication of the council\u0027s responsibilities. In recent months, some of his colleagues have begun to agree. Filner guided the Balboa Park Master Plan to adoption, insisting that it call for maximizing open space. He has brought capital improvement funds to South Bay parks and worked on the revitalization of San Ysidro Boulevard. Last month he called for higher taxes to put more police on city streets. Filner has proven himself one of the council\u0027s most ardent slow-growth advocates and remains a solid pro-environment vote. He has defended the Sierra Club from attempts to oust the organization from its Balboa Park office. \"Bob Filner is one of the few consistent supporters, who has been out there and has been aggressively fighting for the preservation of open space and sensitive lands,\" said the Sierra Club\u0027s Bamberger. Filner pledged to soften his tone if it will mean more success for his district, which could be vulnerable in next year\u0027s redistricting. \"I\u0027m willing to look at my own behavior,\" he said. \"If it\u0027s hurting me from achieving things for my district, that will change.\" But he adds: \"I\u0027m an outspoken person. I represent a district that has historically been powerless. I\u0027m going to continue to (be outspoken). If that gets me into trouble, so be it.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition SUPPORT FOR SHERIFF I was quite surprised at how uninformed the L.A. Times was in writing the editorial on Sheriff Duffy, (\"It\u0027s Time to Hear From Sheriff Duffy,\" Dec. 11). The San Diego Union reported a case where an ex-deputy was cleared by a jury of brutality. A victory for the Sheriff\u0027s Department. This jury saw through the absurdity of this lawsuit. It should be against the law to file frivolous lawsuits. The courts are already overburdened. It\u0027s a waste of taxpayers\u0027 money. These claims of brutality are probably being blown out of proportion, never occurred, or cons trying to con the county out of money. In fact, I hope that the sheriff\u0027s deputies countersue. The Times says that Duffy should speak out. Well, I\u0027m sure that the reason he or his designated official won\u0027t say anything is that anything they say might be detrimental to the cases. He has already won one case, and I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll win more without saying anything. The Times wants to consider a civilian review board. A law enforcement officer\u0027s worst nightmare is to have a civilian, who is not trained in the law enforcement procedures, who does not have to deal with the bad side of the public, to judge whether the law enforcement officer was right or wrong. All The Times has to do is check their stories to see that the Sheriff\u0027s Department does \"police\" its own. The media have reported at least three cases, that I know of, where sheriff\u0027s deputies were fired from the department and/or cases taken to the district attorney for criminal charges to be filed. I say no to a civilian review board. In my opinion, the Sheriff\u0027s Department is doing a good job. To reiterate what I saw on a bumper sticker, \"San Diego County Sheriff -- Law Enforcement at its Best.\" LORAN WON Oceanside",

Because San Diego is considering buying out San Diego Gas \u0026 Electric, how about going ahead and acquiring the Chargers as well? Just ponder the plethora of possibilities: Lighting the stadium would be absolutely free, and Charger fans may be eligible to apply for a rebate on ticket prices from the Public Utilities Commission. As part of incentive clauses for free agents, the city/Chargers could offer such bonuses as light bulbs, generators, consulting fees and preferred stock. The mayor, in her spare time, could coach the team. We could trade Tom Page and Steve Ortmayer for a Tucson utility and a substance-abusing linebacker to be named later. As part of the Russian arts festival, the Chargers might scrimmage with members of the Kirov Ballet. Perhaps the San Diego Chicken could hatch out of a giant Faberge egg during halftime and do a humorous rendition of Swan Lake. If all this wouldn\u0027t give that mean old ogre of a Howard Allen from Southern California Edison fits, I don\u0027t know what will. Think about it, San Diego.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition FOOD FOR THOUGHT: CRUMBS FOR MIGRANTS The Dec. 18 article (\"Breaking Camp\") relating to the housing problem of migrant farm workers in North San Diego County was indeed upsetting, but not surprising. During my four years as California state director of migrant education, I had the opportunity to visit many migrant camps and other farm worker housing throughout the state. The impressions leave a lasting dismal memory in my mind . . . as well as deep anger that our society can treat one segment of our population so callously. To the farmer, as well as the community, the workers are an implement to be used for bringing in the crops, then to be ignored, like machinery or farm animals. They are not perceived as human beings. . . . like you and me. Yet they are very human . . . perhaps most of them are more decent humans than many of us. They live in a close-knit family, loyal to each other, with high moral values, and of deep religious beliefs. They are a proud people, unwilling to take a \"handout\": welfare or social services for which they have not worked. Crime, drug or alcohol abuse is rare in these families. Housing is always a problem. They stay in a community for only part of a year. Thus, permanent housing is out of the question. Rental payment for middle-class apartments or houses is well beyond their means. So they are forced to live in camps, caves, shacks, trailers, their cars . . . wherever. Consequently, both they and their children tend to be of poor health, with little chance to learn English and not accepted as part of the community. During the \u002760s, over 20 camps were built for the migratory farm workers in the central valleys of California. The funds came from the federal government to the state, which built the camps cooperatively with the counties, which then managed the camps that were built on land donated by farmers. These facilities are fairly decent temporary housing, and far better than the alternative. Each camp houses about 100 families; and several hundred are turned away each year because supply does not meet demand. Currently, I am on the board of directors of the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition. We are a small, nonprofit organization, building farm worker housing, both apartments and self-help homes. Our first two projects, built with federal and state funds, provided very decent multi-bedroom housing for 100 families, and we are funded for an additional 140 units. Five hundred families applied for the first 50 units. We\u0027ll keep building until all families are out of the ditches and shacks and filthy camps . . . or until the money runs out. So I read about the solution used in North San Diego County: bulldoze the only housing the farm workers have been able to provide for themselves! Assure that 14,000 workers and their families are homeless. Despite the rationalizations by the local officials, this action is the most brutal which has yet come to my attention. I guess Congressman Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) speaks for the majority of the folks in that area when he throws the responsibility for finding housing and meeting health regulations back on the migrant workers. I wish he could spend a few days living under their circumstances. There are solutions. Let the growers, who need the workers, donate a few acres each for camps. At the state level, Proposition 84 specifically provides $10 million for the construction of migrant farm labor camps. It wouldn\u0027t take much, in terms of federal or state spending. And, provide something more decent than the current proposal down there: a 14-foot plastic unit to house a family of four. Unbelievable! Would Congressman Packard move his family into such a unit? Just think! If readers of this letter are compassionate, or if they are Republicans who believe the private sector should solve all problems . . . if all those readers contributed $10 each; then that money might be sufficient to house an awful lot of workers who provide the food on our table, and who live worse than any other segment of our population. But then, who really cares? FRED WOLFF La Quinta",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition LINGUISTS DELVE MANY MILLENIA INTO PAST TO FIND MAN\u0027S MOTHER TONGUE If this renegade group of linguists could board a time machine, they probably would press the accelerator to the floor -- moving backward through the ages to a time before Sanskrit, English, Punjabi or Japanese. Hurtling back to a remote part of the past before people ever learned to farm, past the era when humans first used fire to a period 100,000 years ago. That is the time they think they will find the critical evidence, the seedlings that produced all of the world\u0027s languages, something they like to call the Mother Tongue of Man. Such a discovery, this group of mostly Soviet and East European researchers believe, would prove what is called the monogenesis of language, the evolution of the spoken word from a single tongue. But while even these scientists think the 100,000-year mark could eventually prove to be too deep in the remote past, they have made headway in reconstructing hundreds of words they believe were spoken 15,000 to 30,000 years ago. Historical linguist Vitaly Shevoroshkin of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor sees a host of applications for biology and anthropology in the work he and his colleagues in the Soviet Union have done. For one, the evolution of language not only shows \"how some words have become petrified,\" by not changing much over time but also how people have migrated around the world. Yet he laments the work has generated little interest in the West. To hear Shevoroshkin tell it, only a handful of Americans are interested in learning the words spoken by early Homo sapiens sapiens, the prehistoric humans whom paleobiologists believe first appeared 100,000 years ago and are the direct ancestors of modern people. Shevoroshkin theorizes that it is possible to pinpoint at least a few original words of man, elements from a language that served as the progenitor for all of those ever spoken on Earth. \"We would like to reconstruct the proto-proto-proto language, if you will, the Mother Tongue. \"A proto language means a language family like Indo-European. If you say proto-proto that\u0027s an ancestor of a family, not everybody accepts that idea especially people in the West. \"But when you say proto-proto-proto, that\u0027s something completely different. Perhaps we may not find the mother tongue, the language of the world, maybe we can go back only 30,000 years. \"There is a big gap between people speaking some type of language 30,000 years ago and one spoken 100,000 years ago. That is a very big gap and we don\u0027t know how to fill it.\" As part of his quest, however, Shevoroshkin hopes to find the links that tie the world\u0027s languages together and link them to the past. To this end, he is building on the work of Soviet linguists Sergei Starostin, Vladislav Marakovic Illic-Svityc and Aaron Dolgopolsky who more than 20 years ago tediously reconstructed a language spoken 15,000 years ago they call Nostratic, which means \"our language.\" Shevoroshkin said 1,000 words of Nostratic have been reconstructed by analysis of common elements from languages he and other scholars believe grew out of the ancient tongue. Nostratic, they believe, gave rise to the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Kartvelian, Euralic, Dravidian, Altaic and Eskimo-Aleutian language families. Hence, making Nostratic a superfamily of languages, or as Shevoroshkin would put it -- a proto-proto language. His hope is to continue on to the proto-proto-proto stage, if he can find the clues that will link him to the remote past. Language is unique to the human species, Shevoroshkin said, and one of the primary characteristics like upright walking and a highly evolved brain that set humans apart from their cousin primates, the Great Apes. He believes by way of a technique called deep reconstruction, he can tap into the vocabularies of ancient humans, seeking first those elements that exist in every language in the world -- first and second person pronouns and names for parts of the body. Such studies produced one of the startling findings in Nostratic, he said. By studying the word for \"eye\" in many languages, Soviet researchers were able to surmise what the word was in Nostratic. \"In English, the word is eye. But in German it is auge, very similar. In old Russian it is oko and in Nostratic we believe it was huka.\" Words for nature also lend themselves to historic analysis, he said, emphasizing that because there was no agriculture before 10,000 years ago there are no words for domesticated animals other than dog. Nostratic scholars have been able to trace that noun among others, he said. But even Shevoroshkin admits this is an arduous task and acknowledges that many historical linguists doubt he can delve too deeply into the remote past to find a language before Nostratic. Stanford University linguistic anthropologist Joseph Greenberg, who has developed a technique called mass comparisons for analyzing various languages, is one who questions how well Shevoroshkin will do. Greenberg, himself interested in the evolution of the various languages of the world, prefers not to seek the vocabularies of early humankind but to classify Earth\u0027s myriad tongues past and present. His work produced the classification of African languages in the 1950s, the groupings generally accepted by linguists today. Greenberg would not call the efforts of Shevoroshkin and his co-investigators futile but allowed the exercise could prove tedious. \"There\u0027s enough to show that all human languages have a common origin,\" said Greenberg. \"I think the really interesting part comes in constructing a family tree (of languages).\" But the problem with family trees, Shevoroshkin said, is that it is easy to leave out vast groups of languages and never show how one is related to another. \"Linguists divide languages into several families such as Uralic, Indo-European or Afro-Asiatic, and so on. They usually say they are not related and if they are there is no proof. \"It is our intention to find the proof and to go beyond that,\" Shevoroshkin said of his endeavor. \"People in this area usually talk about relationships and that makes little sense to me,\" offered Greenberg. But linguist Merritt Ruhlen, formerly of Stanford, acknowledged recently in the journal Science that Shevoroshkin probably is right, that there is an ancient link tying the world\u0027s languages to a common tongue.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition TRYING TIME FOR NEW COURTHOUSE; COUNTY, BUILDER BATTLE OVER UNFINISHED VAN NUYS PROJECT At its unveiling in mid-October, it was hailed as one of the finest court buildings in the nation, a gleaming glass-and-granite edifice to justice that would thrust the San Fernando Valley into the forefront of courthouse design. But the new $52-million Van Nuys Municipal Courthouse may become the subject of litigation unless a multimillion-dollar dispute between the contractor and Los Angeles County officials is resolved. Originally, plans had called for Municipal Court personnel to move into the plush, 11-story, 23-court building, which has its own helipad, 10th-floor balcony and state-of-the-art security system, in August. But 4 months later, the new building is still occupied by construction workers. The Municipal Court staff continues to use cramped, makeshift quarters in bungalows and trailers and on a floor of the Van Nuys Superior Court building next door. Locked in Negotiations County officials and Sylmar-based Tutor-Saliba Corp., the contractor, are locked in negotiations over claims that each side is responsible for the delays and owes the other millions of dollars. The county on Dec. 1 assessed Tutor-Saliba with late penalties of $3 million for failing to have the building ready by Aug. 15, the completion date specified in the contract. The penalties will continue to mount at the rate of $28,000 for each day beyond the completion date, said Thomas V. Schriber, the county\u0027s chief manager on the courthouse project. The total by the end of December was $3.8 million, county officials said. Such penalties are standard in construction projects and were spelled out in the 1985 contract between the county and Tutor-Saliba, the low bidder for the project, Schriber said. The penalties represent the cost to the county of not being able to occupy the building, he said. For instance, the county must keep inspectors and project managers at the site, lease space elsewhere and pay other costs because the new building is not yet open, Schriber said. Charges Contested Tutor-Saliba is contesting the extra charges and accuses the county of causing the delays. Tutor-Saliba has filed a claim seeking $1.7 million from the county for costs that the company says it has incurred because of the delays. \"On numerous occasions over the past 8 months, this office has advised your firm . . . of our serious concern over your firm\u0027s lack of progress on completing this project,\" Schriber wrote in a Dec. 1 letter to Tutor-Saliba. Schriber\u0027s letter said work was not complete on courthouse communications and elevator systems, nor on mechanical, fire, safety and electrical systems. It cited the need to replace damaged glass windows, carpets and doors that were not inspected for fire safety. \"To our view, the contractor is not performing as well as we would like,\" said Jim Abbott, senior deputy director of the county Facilities Management Department. \"It\u0027s fair to say the quality of the work is fine; it\u0027s just that it\u0027s taking longer to get the work done than we feel it should have. \"Once the courthouse dedication was held,\" Abbott said, Tutor-Saliba \"lost their concentration on the job.\" President Blames County Ronald N. Tutor, Tutor-Saliba\u0027s president, scoffed at the charges and accused the county of \"trying to cover up their own inadequacies\" by blaming the contractor for delays. \"That\u0027s a bunch of nonsense. The job is being finished up in spite of the county, not because of it,\" Tutor said. \"The county couldn\u0027t build a building on time if it tried. \"They know they don\u0027t have a prayer in hell of collecting any part\" of the penalty fees, he added. Tutor said the project has taken longer than scheduled because the county has repeatedly changed specifications, a charge that Abbott denies. Tutor claims that the company is entitled to more time to complete the project without late penalties because the county has required so many changes. The delays are inconveniencing Municipal Court personnel in Van Nuys, said Aviva K. Bobb, the court\u0027s presiding judge. \"We are very concerned by the 6-month delay in occupying the building. We are anxious to move in as soon as possible,\" Bobb said. \"The major hardship has been that the court is spread all over the block. . . . It causes a lot of delays, inefficiencies.\" The county has also had to delay plans to renovate the Superior Court building and to open Juvenile Courts in bungalows now occupied by Municipal courtrooms. The latest tentative plans call for the county to occupy the courthouse in mid-January and open it to the public in mid-February, said Peggy Shuttleworth, Valley division chief of the Los Angeles Municipal Court. The building still has to pass inspection by county employees and state fire marshals, Abbott said. It has failed several preliminary fire inspections in part because doors were not properly fitted and certified as fire-resistant, he said. The county is trying to resolve the problems through negotiations with the company\u0027s top management, Abbott said. If negotiations break down, a lawsuit is one of several options that would be considered, he said. If Tutor-Saliba fails to finish the job, Schriber said, the county would suspend the firm\u0027s contract and have the work done elsewhere. The building was formally dedicated Oct. 14 at a ceremony attended by more than 500 people, including county and court officials, politicians and state Supreme Court Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas. Graffiti-Resistant Interior The new courthouse features a graffiti-resistant interior; electronic message boards, similar to those used at ballparks, to provide information on court services, and a specially designed, high-security courtroom featuring a bulletproof glass shield to separate spectators from trial participants. The court\u0027s advanced security system features metal detectors, baggage X-ray machines and closed-circuit cameras in public hallways and high-volume courtrooms as well as custody areas. The courthouse was funded by the sale of public bonds and by the Robbins Construction Fund, which adds a penalty assessment to traffic and parking tickets, said Jerry Orland, head of the project management division of the Facilities Management Department. It is not the first time that Tutor-Saliba has been accused of foot-dragging on a county courthouse project. The contractor is building a $19-million Los Angeles Municipal Courthouse in Cerritos, which is 6 months behind schedule and has engendered similar charges and countercharges, Orland said. \"We\u0027re in the same boat there,\" Orland said. Tutor-Saliba is one of the largest general contractors in California, ranking 70th nationwide in 1987 with $305.3 million in contract awards, according to Engineering News-Record, a trade publication. Tutor-Saliba was awarded an $18.3-million contract by the state Department of Transportation to widen a 2-mile stretch of the Ventura Freeway from Valley Circle Boulevard to White Oak Avenue. Built Airport Terminal The company built the $125-million Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport and is doing $124 million worth of work on the Metro Rail subway project in Los Angeles. Many of the items cited in the county\u0027s Dec. 1 letter have since been fixed, but some problems remain, officials said. On a recent tour of the courthouse, county inspectors pointed out such defects as seams and discolorations on carpets, scratches on glass windows and walls that needed touch-up paint. Other problems included double doors that must be replaced because they were too narrow to lock and wheelchair lifts that failed to function during a recent inspection. \"At this point, a lot of the changes are just cosmetic stuff and 98% of the work is already done,\" said Mike McNeil, county building inspector. \"But when you\u0027re talking about a $52-million building, that 2% adds up to a lot of little things left to be done.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition GETTING TO KNOW HIM; FAMILIARITY WITH CURTIS R. TUCKER JR. MAY BE IN NAME ONLY Who is Curtis R. Tucker Jr.? Six months ago, he was a little-known legislative aide whose father -- Curtis R. Tucker, the feisty political patriarch of Inglewood -- was on his way to an eighth term as assemblyman from the 50th District. Today, the younger Tucker is considered the heavy favorite in a special election to replace his father, who died of cancer in October. One of the state\u0027s most powerful politicians, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), has made it clear that he intends to use his financial and political muscle to get Tucker elected. Brown even persuaded Gov. George Deukmejian to move up the election from April 11 to Feb. 7, shortening the time that other candidates have to raise money and campaign. Brown\u0027s heavy support for Tucker appears to have discouraged several other potentially strong candidates from entering the race. The four candidates who decided to run against Tucker are considered unlikely to raise enough money to compete with Brown\u0027s resources. Little-Known Candidate In interviews, many elected officials and others in Inglewood -- the political heart of the district -- say they know little about Tucker. The other candidates in the race plan to exploit the voters\u0027 lack of familiarity with Tucker. \"Why hasn\u0027t he made himself known?\" asks candidate Rod Wright, a veteran political consultant. \"You don\u0027t say, \u0027My father did this and this, so vote for me.\u0027 That\u0027s not the way it works in America.\" Tucker acknowledges that he has kept a low profile in the district. While his brother-in-law, John Gibbs, served as the assemblyman\u0027s legislative aide in the 50th District, Tucker worked five years as an aide to mid-Wilshire Assemblyman Mike Roos, the Assembly speaker pro tem, before going to work for Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) in the neighboring 49th District eight months ago. \"I haven\u0027t spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked,\" Tucker said. \"But I am known in the district. I know the players.\" The heir apparent is 34, a tall, husky, bearded man with glasses. In an interview last week, he seemed comfortable with his new role in the limelight. He talked freely about the issue that may dominate the abbreviated campaign: himself. \"If they spend all their time making me an issue, fine,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be talking about the real issues: health, crime, airport noise.\" Called Brown\u0027s Puppet Of his critics and rival candidates -- who dismiss him as a puppet of Brown whose only credential is his name -- Tucker said: \"They\u0027re discounting what I\u0027ve done for the past six years, who I know, and how the real world works. It\u0027s sour grapes.\" Asserting that most people in politics have a mentor, he added: \"They have to realize the nature of politics and remember how they got where they are.\" Rival candidate Lois Hill-Hale, an Inglewood school board member and former aide to state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), said voters will resent Brown\u0027s \"big boss\" tactics. She said she has never encountered Tucker during 10 years of political work in Sacramento and in the 50th District. She said many voters do not know that the elder Tucker has died, and she predicted that her opponent would exploit that confusion. \"I think he\u0027s going to keep as low a profile as possible and hope that as many as people as possible will not find out that his father has passed,\" she said. Tucker responded: \"A lot of people have told me, don\u0027t use \u0027junior\u0027 on your name, don\u0027t change the color of your father\u0027s campaign signs, don\u0027t use your picture on literature. But I\u0027m not trying to fool anybody. I\u0027ll always be junior.\" Follow Father\u0027s Agenda Tucker promises to carry on his father\u0027s policies, particularly the careful attention to constituents that was the foundation of the assemblyman\u0027s strength, along with big war chests financed by the health industry and labor. Tucker says his legislative office will provide \"one-stop\" service for constituents who need help. He says his differences with his father are largely a matter of style, though he considers himself slightly more conservative on issues such as crime. \"He favored capital punishment, but I\u0027d be more likely to use it,\" he said. \"I believe it\u0027s a deterrent, and I believe it\u0027s cheaper to throw the switch than to pay to keep someone in jail.\" Tucker\u0027s upbringing was steeped in politics. His family was known as \"the Tucker army\" because of their involvement in the career of their father, who was appointed Inglewood\u0027s first black councilman in 1972, was elected to the Assembly two years later and eventually became Health Committee chairman. As the third of five children and the only son of a \"very strong\" father, Tucker says he was restless and resisted his father\u0027s pressure to follow a rapid career path. Instead, he attended several colleges, finally earning a bachelor\u0027s degree in history from Cal State Dominguez Hills in 1980. He also worked in construction for Pacific Telephone. \"I wanted to see what was out there,\" Tucker said. \"I liked climbing poles and filling manholes. It gave me a different perspective on life. My father didn\u0027t like it, but he knew I\u0027d eventually get tired of getting wet and dirty.\" Tucker, who is married and has two children, entered politics in 1983 as a legislative assistant based in Roos\u0027 46th District field office. He acted as a liaison with community groups on several projects, according to people who worked with him, including a 1986 bill (AB 2700) to toughen penalties on apartment owners who did not cooperate with police against drug-dealing tenants. He also worked on preparing a 1987 bill (AB 1700) that provided incentives to the Los Angeles Unified School District to build multistory school buildings rather than tear down neighboring homes. \"It gives the school board money to build more creatively on less land,\" Tucker said. \"It suppresses the need of cutting further into housing stock.\" Praised Effort A legislative staffer who knows Tucker\u0027s work praised his efforts on that bill. \"The school district was happy and the homeowners were happy,\" the staffer said. \"I\u0027d give Curtis an \u0027A\u0027 on that one.\" The staffer described Tucker as intelligent and capable. But Tucker\u0027s work sometimes suffered because of absenteeism and a seeming lack of motivation, the staffer said: \"There was some concern about the quality of his work. . . . I think he has the chance to be an above-average assembly member. He has the intellect. The question is, does he have the drive, the fire in the belly?\" Tucker responded: \"I would say that\u0027s one person\u0027s opinion. Everyone is not going to thrilled with your performance. That goes without saying.\" On the other hand, George Allen, executive director of the Wilshire Chamber of Commerce on which Tucker served as Roos\u0027 representative, had nothing but praise. \"He\u0027s an outstanding young man and a hard worker,\" Allen said. \"I highly recommend him.\" Positioning for Future Whatever Tucker\u0027s early doubts about a future in politics, he said his move this year to Assemblywoman Moore\u0027s office was calculated to bring him closer to the 50th District and position him for the future. Asked why his father did not hire him as an aide, Tucker said they both believed it was better they did not work in the same office for both political and personal reasons. \"The press would have had a field day with it,\" he said. \"One family member shouldn\u0027t work directly for another.\" But the family had a synchronized political agenda, Tucker said. Having turned 70, Assemblyman Tucker intended his 1988-90 term to be his last; in 1990, the plan was for Curtis Jr. to take center stage. \"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood,\" Tucker said. \"He would have run for mayor, and I would have run for Assembly in 1990.\" But the elder Tucker\u0027s death has \"speeded up the process tremendously,\" he said. Tucker\u0027s sudden emergence appears to have frustrated the ambitions of potential rivals, such as Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and Councilman Daniel Tabor, both of whom have carefully built their careers toward a run for the Assembly. Both have said Tucker is not entitled to the seat simply because of his name. \u0027Has He Paid His Dues?\u0027 \"The opportunity to select among a qualified field of candidates has been eliminated,\" Tabor said. Alluding to the predominantly black voter base in the district, he added: \"The real question is, how well does the African-American community manage the process of preparing leaders for the future? You tell people to go out and pay dues. Has he paid his dues?\" Tucker says he has. \"There is no prerequisite course for being a member of the Assembly,\" he said. \"There should be a need to serve and a desire to do a good job.\" Tucker hopes to win election Feb. 7 by capturing more than 50% of the vote, thus avoiding an April 11 runoff against Mike Davis, the only Republican running. Tucker says his campaign plans to spend between $100,000 and $150,000 on the race and will use an adviser from Brown\u0027s Sacramento operation, as well as political consultant Parke Skelton, who ran the elder Tucker\u0027s last campaign. If elected, Tucker said he will follow his father\u0027s lead in giving special attention to health matters; he hopes to work on a comprehensive package of health-care legislation being prepared by Brown that will be named after the elder Tucker. He also said that although his father had a mild aversion to publicity, especially television, he plans to have a higher profile and use the media to report on what he is doing in Sacramento. Tucker\u0027s opponents look forward to confronting him on equal footing at debates scheduled for next month. They say Tucker\u0027s advantage will crumble when voters compare the candidates in person. But Frank Lewis, an Inglewood dentist and longtime Tucker ally, said Tucker will live up to his father\u0027s legacy. \"He\u0027s quiet,\" Lewis said. \"But he knows politics. He\u0027s well-versed. People are going to be surprised.\" Tucker said: \"So many people who go into politics have a puffed up sense of self-worth. My father never took himself seriously. . . . And I\u0027m still the same person who hung off telephone poles. I have no illusions about who I am.\" TUCKER ON RECORD \"I haven\u0027t spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked, but I am known in the district. I know the players.\" \"(My critics) are discounting what I\u0027ve done for the past six years, who I know, and how the real world works. It\u0027s sour grapes.\" \"A lot of people have told me, don\u0027t use \u0027junior\u0027 on your name, don\u0027t change the color of your father\u0027s campaign signs, don\u0027t use your picture on literature. But I\u0027m not trying to fool anybody. I\u0027ll always be junior.\" \"(My father) favored capital punishment, but I\u0027d be more likely to use it. I believe it\u0027s a deterrent, and I believe it\u0027s cheaper to throw the switch than to pay to keep someone in jail.\" \"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood. He would have run for mayor, and I would have run for Assembly in 1990. (But the elder Tucker\u0027s death has \"speeded up the process tremendously.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition ARCHDIOCESE SEEKS WOMAN\u0027S EVICTION; CHURCH WANTS TO USE HOME WHERE 20-YEAR TENANT HAS LIVED RENT-FREE Officials of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles say they have been patient with Antonia Martin, but their patience has run out. They want the 59-year-old Torrance woman to pack her bags and leave the church-owned Torrance house where she has lived for 20 years. Martin says she can\u0027t afford to move. So on Jan. 11, the archdiocese will ask a South Bay Municipal Court judge to evict her. Paid No Rent The 600-square-foot wood-frame house at 20535 Anza Blvd. is on the grounds of St. James Catholic School, where Antonia\u0027s late husband, Angel, was a custodian from 1968 until his death in July of 1987. The church allowed the couple and their two daughters to live there rent-free while he worked at the school. Now that he is gone, the church wants Antonia Martin out of the house so it can be used for school faculty meetings. Martin, who lives alone, contends that a priest at St. James Catholic Church in Redondo Beach, which runs the school, told her in November that she could stay until she could afford to move. Now, she said, church officials have gone back on their word. \"I thought that the church would be more sensitive toward me,\" said Martin, who came with her husband to the South Bay from Cuba in 1967. \"I thought they would be more considerate.\" Martin, who said she has a back ailment that prevents her from working, lives on $340-a-month disability checks. She said she can\u0027t find a suitable apartment that she can afford. \"I would move if I could afford it,\" she said. \"I just can\u0027t do it.\" Stay Until June Martin said she only wants to stay in the home until June, when she turns 60 and becomes eligible for Social Security benefits. She said she does not know how much the payments will be, but she hopes the money will enable her to afford an apartment. Neal Blaney director of real estate for the archdiocese, said that if the priest -- who is on vacation and could not be reached -- did promise to let Martin stay, he did not mean she could stay until June, nearly two years after her husband\u0027s death. \"We are not going to give this house to her rent-free forever,\" he said. \"Months have gone by, and we have had no indication that she has found or intends to find other housing.\" The church referred Martin to the Catholic Charities social service agency in Long Beach, but Lupe Macker the regional director, said Martin has \"not been very cooperative.\" Macker said Martin was offered several housing options, including group housing for the elderly and care and board facilities, but none appealed to her. \"She has not accepted the reality that she has to move,\" Macker said. Martin said she wants to stay in the Torrance area and the housing offered by the agency was too far away or had other drawbacks. Mark Todd, a paralegal working for the archdiocese, said the church has offered to allow Martin to stay in the home rent-free until Feb. 15. \"But that is our final offer,\" he said. \"I think the church has been very lenient. There is no doubt about it.\" Margaret Kirby, a Hermosa Beach attorney who has taken Martin\u0027s case, says Martin should be allowed to stay in the house until June because church officials told Martin \"to take all the time you need.\" \"Besides,\" Kirby said, \"if the school has been without a meeting place for 20 years, why can\u0027t they wait a few more months?\" Kirby said Martin cannot find other housing because of her limited income. \"You try to find an apartment for $340 a month and see how you do,\" she said. Martin has applied to several retirement homes, but they were too expensive or had long waiting lists, she said. Martin said she does not want to seek help or move in with one of her two grown daughters, one in Lomita and one in Cerritos, because \"they have their own lives, and I don\u0027t want to burden them.\" Both church officials and Martin said they are willing to negotiate. But if negotiations fail and the case goes to court, Martin said, \"I just hope God\u0027s grace is with me.\"",

With numerous species, cockleburs are plentiful throughout the United States. The most frequently seen in California are Xanthium strumarium and Xanthium spinosum. Xanthium is a Greek word meaning yellow and was the ancient name of a plant used to dye hair. Although their origin is unknown, cockleburs are not considered native plants. Often pesky, they can develop solid stands on river flood plains covering many acres. Because each bur-like fruit contains two seeds that produces its own generation of offspring, cockleburs are difficult to eradicate once started. One of the seeds requires much more oxygen than the other and remains dormant for a year longer than its twin. Seeds are protected by airtight coats. Cockleburs are bushy plants that grow to about 3 feet tall. Their inconspicuous flowers are greenish and minute. The hairy, egg-shaped burs are about half-an-inch long and covered with hooked prickles that attach themselves to animal fur, manes and tails. The stems are covered with tiny hairs. The oval to wedge-shaped leaves are toothed and 2 to 5 inches long. They are thick in texture and usually are three-lobed. Cockleburs in the seedling stage are poisonous to animals. MAYERENE BARKER",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition JIM MURRAY: 1988: IT WAS VINTAGE YEAR FOR LOSERS Hello 1989, I thought you\u0027d never get here. 1988? I thought you\u0027d never leave. In a way, it was the Year of the Loser. In order, they were: 1. Ben Johnson -- Oh, rare, Ben Johnson. How can anyone lose more devastatingly than at the very hour of achieving his life\u0027s ambition? When it all falls to ashes just after all one\u0027s dreams are realized, when the world is at his feet, when what you have worked for, strived for, dreamed of all your life has just come true -- and someone comes in and tells you it\u0027s all been a mistake. Ben had just won the Olympic gold medal, set the world record and identified himself as the greatest sprinter of all time when suddenly a man in a white lab coat turns it to nightmare. When they stripped Jim Thorpe of his medals, he became an object of pity. Ben Johnson became an object of scorn. He lost more than a medal. He lost respect. Ben makes loser-of-the-year unanimously. 2. Dave Stieb -- Would you classify as a loser a pitcher who lost a no-hitter with two-out in the bottom on the ninth to a bad-hop single through the infield? OK, how about a pitcher who lost two no-hitters in a row that way? That, my friends, is major-league losing. Just a twist here and you\u0027re looking at the second guy in major-league history to pitch back-to-back no- hitters. You are looking at Johnny Vander Meer II. You are looking at a guy who will become the answer to a trivia question through 2000 A.D. Alas! The ball hopped. 3. Pat Dye -- How do you become a loser-of-the-year when you have the ball on your opponents\u0027 13-yard line, 3 points behind, with 4 seconds left to play? Right! You kick a field goal. A losers\u0027 play. You go for the tie. You strike your colors, fold your hand, cry uncle. It\u0027s what Auburn coach Pat Dye did in last year\u0027s Sugar Bowl against Syracuse. Whatever happened to \"Winning isn\u0027t everything, it\u0027s the only thing?\" Whatever became of Fight, fight, fight? Stonewall Jackson would never understand. Neither would George Gipp. Woody Hayes would hit somebody. 4. Davey Johnson -- How would you like to be in Game 7 of the playoff series for the National League pennant and have a pitcher on your staff who is known as \"Dr.K,\" who has struck out more than 1,000 batters, won 18 games in the season and is only 23 years old. He is on the bench with 3 days rest. The opposition is starting its best pitcher who has had only 3 days rest and has already pitched 3 times in the series. Nevertheless, Manager Davey Johnson doesn\u0027t start Dwight Gooden in the most important game of the season. The Mets manager starts Ron Darling with predictable results. He doesn\u0027t save Gooden anyway. Dwight gets in the game with the score 6-0 and the pennant gone. In the other dugout, Manager Tom Lasorda plays the ace -- Orel Hershiser. Davey Johnson makes loser-of-the-year by acclamation, the pinup boy for every second-guesser east of the Tehachapis. 5. Dennis Eckersley -- How would you like to be the best relief pitcher in the American League with a league-leading 45 saves, an ERA of 2.35, a record of having only walked 11 batsmen all year and a record of having finished 53 of the 60 games you appeared -- and in the ninth inning of the first World Series game, you are breezing along with a 4-3 lead and have just retired the first two batters to face you, one by strikeout, the other by weak grounder. You need an out to, maybe, just clinch the whole World Series when up comes this batter who has hit just .196 all year with no great reputation for power (he has hit 2 home runs and has 17 runs-batted-in). He strikes out a lot (once every 4 1/2 times at-bat). This is not Babe Ruth but you, you, unaccountably, begin to pitch to him as if he were. The next thing you know, you have just walked Mike Davis and put the tying run on first base. But, never mind. Get a load of the guy who\u0027s coming up to pinch-hit. He looks like a guy leaving a train wreck. He can hardly walk. He winces just lifting the bat. He\u0027s only going to tap the ball into play some place and hope for a big break. This is the only at-bat he\u0027ll get in the whole Series and he doesn\u0027t look as if he can handle even this. You get two quick strikes on this refugee from the disabled list and this looks like a mismatch. The chances are good he couldn\u0027t get around on a medium-good fastball if you sent it up there with stamps on it. So, for some reasons best known to the gremlins of baseball, you decide to try what you call a \"backdoor slider\" on him. Now, the slider is the pitch the late Fresco Thompson used to say was going to put * lot of .270 hitters in the Hall of Fame. It was, he said, the pitch that let Maris break Babe Ruth\u0027s home-run record. It has been variously described as the \"nickel curve,\" the \"downtown pitch,\" and, when it doesn\u0027t work, as \"the slop slider.\" This one you let go of is all three. At the bat, Kirk Gibson can\u0027t believe his good luck. His eyes get big, his groin doesn\u0027t hurt any more. He dreams of pitches like this. As Joe Garagiola would say, \"you couldn\u0027t order a better one from room service.\" Gibson swings. Not hard, just about like a guy lofting a 9-iron to a trapped green. It is out of the lot the minute it leaves the bat. It is one of the historic home runs of baseball history. It wins, to all intents and purposes, the World Series. It is a pitch Dennis Eckersley probably wanted to run after and retrieve the minute he let go of it. To call time. Pray for an earthquake. Anything to get that ball back in his glove before it goes into the right-field seats. That pitch is one of the great losers of 1988. It is a game-loser and a Series-loser. They don\u0027t get any worse than that. John McEnroe-Who?",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition THE NFL PLAYOFFS; BEARS BEAT EAGLES IN PEA SOUPER BOWL, 20-12; CHICAGO ROLLS PAST PHILADELPHIA AS FOG BLANKETS SOLDIER FIELD You just couldn\u0027t see the Chicago Bears beating the Philadelphia Eagles Saturday in their National Football Conference semifinal playoff game. Oh, the Bears won, 20-12. You just couldn\u0027t see it. Or much of anything else on a day when fog, rolling in off Lake Michigan, severely hampered visibility at Soldier Field. Veterans in the press box said it was the worst they\u0027d seen, or rather not seen, at this stadium in half a century. Who knows? When they review the film, they may yet discover Philadelphia won. Mike Ditka vs. Buddy Ryan? This was more like Sherlock Holmes vs. Professor Moriarty. But in the end, as is often the case at Soldier Field, blue sky or no sky, the game came down to the Bear defensive unit. Ranked No. 2 in the National Football League, it lived up to its ranking, intercepting 3 Randall Cunningham passes and holding the Eagles to 52 yards rushing. And the Eagles helped out by constantly breaking down offensively. Penalties, dropped passes, missed opportunities -- Philadelphia was guilty of all that as it failed to reach the end zone despite the fact that Cunningham completed 27 of 54 passes for 407 yards. At times, the players couldn\u0027t even see the end zone. \"What I could see was about 20 yards downfield,\" Cunningham said. \"If you take your 10-yard dropback, you could see only about 15 yards. \"We had to change to our short routes. They knew that. But let me say first, we beat ourselves.\" And much to the delight of the crowd of 65,534. Or at least that portion of the crowd that could see what was going on. Pity the poor fan who shelled out $30 to sit in a seat and watch the blurry figures fade in and out of the mist. Kind of like paying for a big fight to be beamed into your living room only to have the picture go out on your television set. In the press box, the media were reduced to listening to reports from the field or watching monitors. How often do you hear the public address announcer say, \"There\u0027s word of a flag on the field.\" Never mind instant replay. Saturday\u0027s game may begin a debate over the use of radar. It was a great day for getting away with holding, 12 men on the field or the hidden-ball trick. It would have been a great afternoon for legendary Bear runner Red Grange, known as the Galloping Ghost. So much for the home-field advantage. The fans can\u0027t cheer for what they can only hear. Strangely enough, the day began with a bright blue sky and the temperature in the 30s. It was under those conditions that the Bears took an early lead. Quarterback Mike Tomczak, starting his first NFL playoff game, made his first completion a memorable one, connecting with Dennis McKinnon on a 64-yard touchdown pass play in the first quarter. \"There was a problem with the coverage, and I think we might have had the right play called,\" Tomczak said. (Receiver Glen) Kozlowski cut underneath, and I think the corner (Roynell Young) was starting to move inside, apparently thinking Dennis was also going inside. Dennis just headed upfield and had the corner beat. It was a great fake on Dennis\u0027 part.\" It also helped that safety Andre Waters, the only man with a shot at McKinnon, fell down. He got up after McKinnon had caught the ball at the Philadelphia 40 and had a shot at the Bear receiver but missed the tackle, leaving McKinnon to celebrate the last 15 yards. In all, Tomczak completed 10 of 20 for 172 yards before he was forced out in the third quarter on a play in which he had his third interception, this one to Terry Hoage. Reggie White hit Tomczak, reinjuring the left shoulder that Tomczak had separated several weeks ago. Jim McMahon, originally forced to the sideline with a twisted knee and then kept there by Tomczak\u0027s success as a starter, finished the game. Ditka, the Bear coach, said he would wait to see how severe Tomczak\u0027s injury is before naming a starter for next week\u0027s NFC championship game, where the Bears will play host to the winner of today\u0027s Minnesota Vikings-San Francisco 49ers game. After giving up the bomb to McKinnon, the Eagles responded with their own aerial attack. Remember, the sun was still out at this point, and the end zone was clearly in sight. But beyond reach. On their first drive after the touchdown, the Eagles wound up with nothing when Luis Zendejas missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. Philadelphia got the ball back on the first play of the Bears\u0027 next drive on Seth Joyner\u0027s interception. Then came one of the Eagles\u0027 most frustrating drives of the season, exceeded only by its next drive. More about that later. Taking over at the Chicago 30, Philadelphia drove to the 9, where Cunningham hit Cris Carter with a pass in the end zone. The apparent touchdown was called back because of illegal motion by running back Anthony Toney. So Cunningham came right back and fired it into the end zone again. This time, 4 men touched the ball. Defenders Dave Duerson and Mike Richardson got a hand on it. Carter also got a piece, batting the ball into the arms of fellow receiver Mike Quick. Touchdown at last? Not quite. Again a penalty. Again Toney. This time holding. So the Eagles settled for Zendejas\u0027 42-yard field goal. In all, he would kick 4, the others coming from 29, 30 and 35 yards. The Eagles\u0027 frustration, however, was just beginning. On their next drive, they reached the Chicago 4, where they faced a fourth and 1. Cunningham kept the ball on a draw and was hit at the line by Dante Jones. The officials brought out the chains. And measured. And checked. And checked again. The verdict? Short by an inch. On their next drive, the Eagles again apparently had a touchdown in their grasp. Keith Jackson was wide open in the end zone, but he jumped too soon for Cunningham\u0027s perfect pass and dropped it. Chicago took the ensuing kickoff and drove to another touchdown, Neal Anderson going in from the Eagle 4 off left tackle. By now the fog rolled in, and the Eagles were ready to roll out of postseason play. The Bears added 6 points on Kevin Butler\u0027s field goals of 46 and 27 yards. When it was over, Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan, a former assistant at Chicago, where he had a long-running feud with Ditka, was asked if he had shaken hands with his former head coach. \"What,\" he asked, \"was there to shake about?\" NFC Playoff Notes The Chicago interceptions were by Mickey Pruitt, Vestee Jackson and Maurice Douglass. . . . Keith Jackson, despite his drop, had a big day receiving with 7 catches for 142 yards. Running back Keith Byars made 9 catches for 103 yards. Byars was Philadelphia\u0027s leading ballcarrier with 34 yards in 7 carries. . . . Thomas Sanders led Chicago with 94 yards rushing, 58 coming on a second-quarter run.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition NHL NOTES; COURTNALL TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO OFFENSE Prior to this season, Geoff Courtnall, the Washington Capitals\u0027 hard-hitting, high-scoring left wing was mainly used as a checker and a guy who would give up his body to go into the boards and create havoc with opposing players. If he scored, all well and good, but his main job was disturbing the other team\u0027s attack. This year all of that has changed and Courtnall is the leading scorer on the Capitals and one of the driving offensive forces in the team\u0027s surge for first place in the Patrick Division of the National Hockey League. \"My job in the past was to go after the other guy,\" said Courtnall, who has 19 goals and 19 assists entering Tuesday night\u0027s game at the Capital Centre at Landover, Md., against the Philadelphia Flyers. \"My concern was not scoring, but stirring things up. I like it much better this year. I like being involved in the scoring. I always had a good shot and I always believed I could score, but that wasn\u0027t my primary role. I did what I was supposed to do.\" In his previous five seasons with the Boston Bruins, Courtnall, 6-feet-1, 195-pound, a native of Victoria, British Columbia, scored 82 goals and handed out 85 assists in 271 games. Last season, one which he split between Boston and Edmonton, was his best scoring year with 36 goals and 30 assists. Barring serious injury, he should easily surpass both figures this season. The Capitals acquired Courtnall, 26, from Edmonton for Greg Adams last July. \"Geoff Courtnall has added a new dimension to our power play and has been our most consistent scorer,\" said Capitals Coach Bryan Murray. \"He is a very aware hockey player. He sees so much of the ice. Not only is he a very adept passer, but he has a tremendous shot. He really has a gun as he has demonstrated on many occasions this season. He has been a very welcome addition to our hockey club.\" Courtnall, whose twin brother Russ plays for the Montreal Canadiens, leads the Capitals in home scoring with 12 goals and 10 assists and had the second longest scoring streak in team history when he scored in 15 consecutive games earlier this season. He leads the team in shots with 120 and collected his 200th National Hockey League point Dec. 7 against the New Jersey Devils. He also has nine power-play goals. Murray, in his eighth season with Washington, achieved his 300th NHL coaching victory Dec. 15. He has coached 581 games and is tied with Tommy Ivan for 16th on the all-time victory list. Ivan coached Detroit and Chicago from 1947 until 1958. Voting for the teams that will compete in the 40th NHL All-Star game Feb. 7 in Edmonton, Alberta, will end Sunday. Voting began in November. The Wales conference All-Stars will be coached by Terry O\u0027Reilly of the Boston Bruins and the Campbell conference team will be coached by Glen Sather of the Edmonton Oilers. Norm Ullman and Bruce MacGregor, both former NHL players, have been named honorary captains for the game. Hartford wing Sylvain Turgeon underwent surgery on a separated left shoulder Thursday and will be sidelined for three months. The Whalers recalled Dallas Gaume from Binghamton of the American Hockey League to replace him. Where are they now? Reggie Leach, who scored the most goals in a season (61 in 1976) for the Philadelphia Flyers and played 13 seasons with the Flyers, Boston, California and Detroit. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1976 when the Flyers won the Stanley Cup by beating Montreal, 4-0. He scored 666 points in 934 games, including 381 goals. Leach owns Sports Lawn Service in New Jersey. Hockey fans in Pittsburgh have missed Wayne Gretzky two years in a row. Last season, when he was with Edmonton, he missed the Oilers\u0027 only game in Pittsburgh because of an injury, and this season he missed the Kings\u0027 only game in Pittsburgh because of his grandmother\u0027s funeral. Gretzky said that his grandmother, Mary Gretzky, used to sit in a chair and play goalie for him when he practiced his shooting. Petr Klima of the Detroit Red Wings has been going through some highs and lows lately. Last week, he went to the airport to meet his parents, Josef and Kveta Klima, for a reunion.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition COMMENTARY; SPORTS COLD WAR IS BEGINNING TO THAW Consider it a positive development in international relations that the Soviets have become frequent tourists. Familiarity has diluted contempt. Alas, it also has dulled the expectations of such meetings. When Mikhail Gorbachev stepped out of a limousine to shake hands with U.S. citizens during his recent visit, he followed the inclination of his nation\u0027s athletes. For more than a decade, they have enjoyed North American hospitality in increasing numbers. Until the advent of glasnost, they just lacked the freedom of expression. Now there is as much interest, if not more, in what they say as in the way they play. When the Central Red Army team meets the New York Islanders at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., Thursday night, the focus will be on defenseman Vyatcheslav Fetisov, not only because he may be the best in the world at what he does, but also because he has made public his frustration in being prevented from joining the New Jersey Devils. \"If it weren\u0027t for Gorbachev,\" he said Wednesday, \"this (discussion) would be impossible.\" But the sports exchanges between East and West preceded the improved dialogue between government officials. This marks the seventh tour of NHL rinks by one or more Soviet clubs in the last 13 years, and that doesn\u0027t include such special events as the Challenge Cup, the Canada Cup or the Rendez-Vous \u002787 series. And hockey is merely the tip of the iceberg. This year, Soviet teams have competed in basketball, volleyball, boxing, wrestling and, yes, even baseball on U.S. soil. The U.S.S.R. has sent us wrestlers and weightlifters, among others, in the past. A decade ago, it even entered a team in World Team Tennis. The team wasn\u0027t very good, but it was the only one in the league that managed to turn a profit. And now we have in our midst the Red Army team and Dynamo Riga team, which played the second game on a western swing Wednesday night in Edmonton, Alberta. The NHL is billing it as a Super Series, but it\u0027s more superfluous than anything. We have passed the point where either side has much to prove in terms of superiority. That wasn\u0027t the case in 1972, of course. The Soviets were regarded as amateurs (in the most derisive sense of the word) by the Canadian hockey establishment when the NHL agreed to make available its seasoned pros in an eight-game hockey summit. Officials laughed at the Soviets\u0027 equipment before the first game at the Montreal Forum, and at least one newspaper columnist promised to eat his words if Team Canada lost as much as one game. \"It was our first training camp,\" Islanders President Bill Torrey recalled Wednesday. \"We watched the game at the beautiful Holiday Inn in Peterborough (Ontario). We went up 2-0 and everyone was saying this is going to be a piece of cake.\" But the Soviets stormed back to win the first game in a rout, and the NHL\u0027s best didn\u0027t clinch a 4-3-1 series victory until the final minute of the final game, played in Moscow. \"That was my last year of midgets,\" said Bryan Trottier, then a 16-year-old in rural Saskatchewan. \"I remember the last game was on at 11 o\u0027clock. The whole school shut down and we all went to the auditorium to watch it on television.\" The drama, intensified by the belief that the teams were upholding a way of life, was riveting. And the lack of previous contact between the groups led to suspicion. There was the story of Wayne Cashman, who, convinced his hotel room in Moscow was bugged, located a foreign-looking object underneath the carpet and proceeded to unscrew it, sending a chandelier in the room below toppling to the floor. From a sporting standpoint, the cold war between East and West ended on the ice in Moscow. The World Hockey Association sent a team of all-stars to Moscow two years later and, in 1976, the Soviets sent two club teams to tour North America. On the evening before the Red Army made its initial appearance at the Coliseum almost 13 years ago, Islanders owner Roy Boe hosted a reception for the visitors. \"If you want plenty of beer or vodka,\" he said, \"we\u0027ll do what we can to help.\" North American teams have since gone beyond providing alcohol for the visitors. Last summer, the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association worked to rehabilitate the Achilles injury that had sidelined Soviet center Arvidas Sabonis. He returned from the injury in time to lead his country to an upset of the U.S. team in the Olympics. Such consideration didn\u0027t make everyone in the United States happy. John Thompson, for one, was critical of Americans giving aid to the enemy even before the team he coached was ambushed in Seoul, South Korea. But, as the Trail Blazers explained, they were only protecting their own investment. They had drafted Sabonis and were hopeful that he would be permitted to wear a Portland uniform after the Olympics. They\u0027re still waiting, as are the Devils for Fetisov. Many on both sides believe it\u0027s inevitable that individual Soviet athletes will be permitted to play for professional teams in North America, further blurring the distinctions in lifestyle that once gave such bite to games between the East and West. \"In the actual situation of world extension, of the relationship between our countries,\" Soviet forward Igor Larionov said Wednesday through an interpreter, \"it\u0027s a good step.\" Larionov has been drafted by the Vancouver Canucks. Is he interested in playing here? \"Why not?\" he replied, smiling. Perhaps some day there will be Soviets sprinkled throughout the NHL, the NBA and other professional leagues. And perhaps at such a time the presence of even the leader of the U.S.S.R. won\u0027t halt traffic in New York.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition DYNAMO RIGA PROVES TOO MUCH FOR KINGS, \u0027COACH\u0027 MCNALL, 5-3 Owner Bruce McNall was behind the Kings\u0027 bench for the game against the Soviet team Saturday night, wearing a sweater proclaiming him, \"Coach.\" Of course, when they presented him with the chance to coach the team in this exhibition game, they expected it to be a pleasant experience. The Kings were supposed to beat Dynamo Riga. The big surprise was that Dynamo Riga defeated the Kings, 5-3, before a crowd of 11,490 at the Forum. \"The coaches wanted me to see what it was like behind the bench,\" McNall said. \"I found out that it\u0027s confusing. It\u0027s upsetting. I don\u0027t know how they do it. . . . It was interesting. But I guess I did something wrong. Anyway, they told me that\u0027s the last time I coach. \"It\u0027s pretty humiliating for me to be canned after my coaching debut.\" It was pretty humiliating for the Kings to lose to Dynamo Riga, a young team that was playing its fourth game in 5 days after traveling from Calgary to Edmonton to Vancouver to Los Angeles. Dynamo Riga, the weaker of the two Soviet teams making a tour of the National Hockey League, had been losing ground with every game. The visitors opened with a 2-2 tie at Calgary, lost at Edmonton, 2-1, then lost at Vancouver, 6-1. But against the Kings, they jumped out to a 5-1 lead before Wayne McBean and Wayne Gretzky narrowed the gap with third-period goals. Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Kings said: \"We weren\u0027t trying to make light of this game by asking Bruce to coach, but we thought it would be a good time to let him see what happens during a game. \"We might have given the impression that this game was not important to us, but it\u0027s only not important until you step on the ice. Then you want to win. \"We have three big (Smythe Division) games coming up, and we wanted to play well. \"Before the third period, we asked the guys to go out and try to win the period to put us in a good frame of mind for going to Calgary, and they did that,\" Ftorek said. The Kings won the final period, 2-0. But that was after the Soviets won the first, 2-1, and the second, 3-0. Dynamo Riga Coach Vladimir Yurzinov said: \"I am satisfied with how my team played tonight. It was a very important game for our team from a psychological point of view. If we had lost this game, it would have put us in a difficult position.\" Asked about the difference between the 2 teams, Yurzinov said: \"The L.A. Kings were not fast tonight. The difference in their speed and ours was just about the same difference as between us and Vancouver.\" The Soviets struck for 2 quick goals in the first period. On the first goal, Anatoli Semenov put his stick on the ice to deflect a pass, which sent the puck flying over goalie Mark Fitzpatrick\u0027s left shoulder at 14:38. Andrei Lomakin got an unassisted goal at 15:31 when Fitzpatrick apparently thought he had made the stop, but the puck had another couple of inches of momentum. It glanced off his stick and into the corner of the goal . Bernie Nicholls scored the first goal for the Kings at 16:26 of the first period, a wrist shot from the left circle. The Soviets took a 3-1 lead in the second period, taking advantage of the power play after Mike Krushelnyski was called for hooking. Sergei Selyanin lifted a left-handed slap shot over the outstretched glove of Fitzpatrick at 6:47. The Soviets went ahead, 4-1, when Alexi Frolikov picked up a loose puck, turned and fired from 40 feet away. Dynamo Riga made it 5-1 when Alexander Smirnov sent the puck from the blue line, through traffic, and past Fitzpatrick. Left wing Bob Carpenter of the Kings suffered a bruised right wrist early in the third period and was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center for X-rays.",

Maybe if I do a good job, they\u0027ll use all their fingers.\" Jim Valvano, North Carolina State basketball coach and athletic director, on college administrators: \"Monday through Friday, they want you to be like Harvard.

He looked more like Dom DeLuise. Now he looks like Michelangelo\u0027s statue David. The only thing that is fat now is his head.\" Lee Trevino, to a woman who saw him washing the windows at his home and asked him how much he charged: \"Lady, the woman in this house lets me sleep with her.\" Billy Martin, asked if he had a drinking problem: \"The only problem is that you run into a guy who\u0027s a banker in the afternoon and thinks he\u0027s King Kong at night. If one of those guys tries something with me, I\u0027ll drop him.\" Golfer JoAnne Carner, crediting Martin with teaching her how to win: \"The only thing I never learned from Billy Martin was how to knock a guy out in a bar.\" Pitcher Mike Scott of the Houston Astros, after the attendance figure of 1938 was put on the scoreboard in Atlanta: \"I didn\u0027t know if that was the attendance or the year Nolan Ryan was born.\" Dodger Manger Tom Lasorda, asked by Chicago reporters how fast Don Sutton was pitching: \"We had him clocked at 92 -- 45 going to Rick Dempsey and 47 coming back.\" Coach John Thompson of Georgetown, on the criticism he\u0027s received: \"It doesn\u0027t bother me. The more I\u0027m criticized, the more my speaking fee goes up.\" Dennis Rodman of the Detroit Pistons, asked if he would kiss Magic Johnson on the cheek as Isiah Thomas did: \"I think we should get engaged first.\" Comedian Jackie Mason, claiming Michael Spinks didn\u0027t train properly for Mike Tyson: \"He should have taken voice lessons, so he could have yelled for help.\" CBS announcer Jim Nantz, at a roast for Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson: \"The only time Jimmy didn\u0027t run up the score was 27 years ago, when he took the SAT.\" Coach Lou Holtz of Notre Dame, on his youth: \"You hear people talking about an inferiority complex. Me, I didn\u0027t have a complex. I was inferior.\" David Letterman: \"Baseball was an exhibition sport in the Olympics this year -- sort of like it was in Baltimore.\" Mickey Hatcher of the Dodgers, on Kirk Gibson\u0027s ninth-inning home run in Game 1 of the World Series: \"I wanted to go out and kiss the guy, but he never shaves.\" Oakland\u0027s Jose Canseco, on Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser: \"I\u0027m going to hire him as my personal hitting coach.\" Craig Fertig, former USC quarterback and assistant coach who is the new associate athletic director at UC Irvine: \"There\u0027s a rumor we\u0027re going to start playing football.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition THE NFL PLAYOFFS; BUFFALO BRACES FOR MORE THAN WEATHER; STRUGGLING BILLS MAY HAVE THEIR DIFFICULTIES AGAINST THOSE ORNERY OILERS The Houston Oilers are coming, the Houston Oilers are coming. America\u0027s incorrigibles are on the road again, their reputations preceding them, threatening another hometown darling. Today it\u0027s the Buffalo Bills, playing their first playoff game at home in 22 years before their wild, crazy, longest-suffering, ready-to-party-hearty fans. The Bills are 3 1/2-point favorites, although a look at their recent record makes you wonder. Meet the Paper Bills? Buffalo had the league\u0027s best record -- 11-1 -- until losing 3 of its last 4. The Bills were outrushed in the losses, 232 to 110 yards, 110-39 and 53-19, an ominous sign for a conservative team. Also, Shane Conlan, the inside linebacker who was a key to their rushing defense until he missed all of the late losses, is expected to sit out again; quarterback Jim Kelly is under increasing fire, and some of it is coming from a teammate. That\u0027s halfback Robb Riddick, who recently told a TV station in Rochester, N.Y., \"I just don\u0027t feel Jim is doing the job he is being paid to do.\" Riddick was upset that the backs weren\u0027t being thrown enough passes, although you have to wonder which games he has been watching. More than one-third of Kelly\u0027s completions have gone to his backs. Coach Marv Levy was upset with the timing of the remarks and said there was nothing to it. \"Robb came back and called Jim Kelly that night,\" Levy said. \"He told him the remarks came out much different than he\u0027d expected and apologized for whatever embarrassment there was. \"Jim said, \u0027Forget it, I know how these things happen, we\u0027ve got more important things to deal with than that.\u0027 \" That Kelly is a brick, isn\u0027t he? Of course, he may have been a tiny bit more perturbed than Levy said he was. Kelly is generally considered one of the game\u0027s best young quarterbacks, has just made the Pro Bowl over such candidates as Dan Marino and John Elway . . . and has been getting ripped in letters to the editor and on radio talk shows by the arch-supportive Bills faithful. There\u0027s a reason for it too -- try 15 touchdown passes against 17 interceptions, compared to the 41-28 ratio he compiled in his first 2 seasons. Irony: As he starts to get his greatest praise since entering the league, he\u0027s drawing his most heat, too. Bottom line: He\u0027s getting angry about it. \"I\u0027m so tired of hearing about negative things,\" he said last week, when the Riddick question came up. But hadn\u0027t Riddick called to apologize, etc.? \"Yeah,\" said Kelly, without enthusiasm, \"he called.\" On the other hand, the Bills still have Bruce Smith (11 sacks in 12 games), Cornelius Bennett (9 1/2), Fred Smerlas and the rest of that rock-ribbed defense that got them here. The Oilers, renowned, warm-weather warriors, will face a more forbidding day than they got last week at Cleveland. The Bills are already braced for all of those Oiler tough-guy tactics, vowing not to retaliate, as the Browns\u0027 Ernest Byner did, earning back-to-back roughing penalties and killing a drive. However, you might conclude that the Oilers\u0027 Raider-type reputation is already working for them: the Bills are spending all this time worrying about what the Oilers will do and how they\u0027ll handle it. Actually, the Oilers have been on their best behavior. Jerry Glanville, fresh from eliminating the Browns and bringing down their coaching staff, took it easy on Buffalo, where he was an assistant 1 season. He said nothing bad about the town, which has provided fertile material for so many comedians, except to remark that he was leaving tickets for the late Jay Silverheels, the local actor who used to play Tonto. For a change, the most hated Oiler isn\u0027t their macho little coach but General Manager Ladd Herzeg. It was Herzeg who, in 1987, was accused of having made an, uh, impolite gesture during an argument at the team\u0027s hotel with members of a wedding party. Assault charges were filed against Herzeg but dropped by a Buffalo judge, on the condition that Herzeg stays out of local trouble. If those wedding receptions quit hassling him, he\u0027ll be fine. AFC Playoff Notes Come Back, Shane: the Bills sent Shane Conlan to Birmingham, Ala., last week to have Dr. James Andrews look at his injured arch which isn\u0027t responding to rest or therapy. Said Coach Marv Levy: \"We\u0027re not counting on him, but we haven\u0027t counted him out.\" . . . Classic confrontation: Houston\u0027s offensive line, with its three, high No. 1 picks (Pro Bowl guards Bruce Matthews and Mike Munchak, and tackle Dean Steinkuhler) against the Bills\u0027 defensive front, which has four No. 1s (Pro Bowl players Bruce Smith, Cornelius Bennett, Conlan and Art Still) and two No. 2s (Pro Bowl player Fred Smerlas and Darryl Talley). . . . Key matchup, or Battle of the Bruces: Oiler left tackle Bruce Davis, the former Raider, vs. Bill right end Bruce Smith, second only to the Eagles\u0027 Reggie White in potential to disable an entire offense by himself. Smerlas, the colorful nose tackle, faces center Jay Pennison, who the Raiders considered the Oiler line\u0027s weak link. Of course, the Raiders thought Smerlas was a hype, too. . . . The Bills are 11-1 when they have rushed for more than 100 yards. However, the underrated Oiler defense was No. 1 in the American Football Conference against the run. . . . Levy, on defensing the Oilers: \"They\u0027re not one dimensional. There\u0027s no one thing to stop. We can\u0027t say something like, \u0027Stop Eric Dickerson and you\u0027ll stop the Colts. It\u0027s not that simple. They have a superior offensive line, great receivers, a fine quarterback (Warren Moon) who gets better all the time and that tremendous stable of runners.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE BOWL GAMES; IT HAS BEEN QUITE A REIGN FOR DUKE; BIG TEN COMMISSIONER WILL RETIRE WHEN A REPLACEMENT IS CHOSEN One of Wayne Duke\u0027s most prized possessions is the clipping from Sports Illustrated that pictures him with John Wayne at the Rose parade. John Wayne sent him the clipping and signed it, \"To Wayne Duke from Duke Wayne.\" Wayne Duke, commissioner of the Big Ten, smiles when he tells about that now-fading momento. So you see, Duke does have some fond memories of the annual trip he has made to California for the Rose Bowl every year for the past 18 years. But ask him about the highlights and lowlights of his New Year\u0027s Day ritual and he gives that familiar Wayne Duke grimace. He had been in town less than 3 hours Wednesday and he had already been asked why the Big Ten can\u0027t win the Rose Bowl. Since announcing his retirement last summer, a retirement that will become effective in the upcoming year when a successor is chosen, Duke has had plenty of opportunities to review his tenure as leader of the Big Ten. The conference boasts the largest football and basketball attendance in the country, and that comes from winning a lot of games. Duke was chairman of the NCAA basketball tournament committee that expanded the field to 64 teams and upped the TV rights so that the tournament now brings in about $55 million. Duke was on the committee that put together a $103 million TV package between the Big Ten and the Rose Bowl that will run through 1997. The Rose Bowl game is truly dear to his heart. Duke has always been able to refer to the game as \"the granddaddy of them all\" without cracking a smile at the corny sound. He believes it. It\u0027s a traditional matchup, and Duke believes that college football should be more traditional, should match schools and school spirits for the pride and the memories and the glory, not an abstract No. 1 and No. 2 for a mythical title. \"You can have a \u0027national championship\u0027 game in Phoenix this year, or, from time to time, in Miami, but this game will be sold out year after year after year,\" Duke said. The Rose Bowl is his kind of college football. Walter Byers, the longtime executive director of the NCAA, now retired, who strongly influenced Duke during his early years in the NCAA office, told the Chicago Tribune: \"We both came from the romantic era in sports. Emphasis was placed on values to be learned from the game. You competed because you enjoyed it.\" While he can get quite philosophical about the over-emphasis on winning and losing, even at the level of eighth-grade soccer his grandson plays, Duke cannot deny the impact it has on him to have to see his teams lose. \"I go in the dressing rooms,\" Duke said. \"I try to go to our team\u0027s dressing room after any game I see in the conference. I always go down after the Rose Bowl game. And there\u0027s a disappointment in there after a loss. People who are critical of our bowl record, or even people who are critical of the team\u0027s performance that day, don\u0027t have to see, first hand, the terrible disappointment that is felt by the players and the coaches who have put so much into the game. \"The guy up in the stands who has been tailgating all day and who thinks he has all the answers, doesn\u0027t have to see what losing does to the players and the coaches.\" Or what it does to Duke, who has come back up to the pressbox looking so distressed that writers have joked about keeping an eye on him so he doesn\u0027t jump from the roof. Duke tries to keep smiling. \"Tom Hansen (commissioner of the Pacific 10) tells me I\u0027m a very good loser,\" Duke said. \"I tell him, that\u0027s because I\u0027ve had a lot of practice.\" But it doesn\u0027t get easier. As he flipped through the pages of his memories, Duke could not seem to separate good times and bad times in Southern California from the wins and the losses. \"I\u0027ll tell you the contrast,\" Duke said. \"The first year we were here and something that happened just last year make a good contrast.\" The first year Duke and his wife, Martha, came out for the Rose Bowl game, Stanford beat Michigan. It was after the 1971 season. For the Duke family, it was an emotional time, anyway. He had become Big Ten commissioner on Sept. 1, 1971, after 8 years as commissioner of the Big Eight and 11 years of service in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. office. They had just sold their home of 19 years to make the move to Chicago. After all those years of going to Miami every holiday season for the Orange Bowl, they were in Southern California -- where it was raining. The Michigan team was having to practice in Bakersfield. Nothing was looking too rosy. And then, the all-important game. In the final minutes of the game, Michigan got a safety to go ahead of Stanford, 12-10. But Don Bunce, the Stanford quarterback, took Stanford down the field and Rod Garcia kicked a field goal to beat the Wolverines. \"Martha and I had been talking about how the final standings would go if Michigan lost, and we knew that Big Eight teams were going to be 1-2-3,\" Duke said. \"We\u0027d been talking about that for days. \"Well, Lawrence Welk was grand marshal of the parade that year, and he was at the Tournament House that night for the party. He stood up there and said, \u0027A-1 and a-2 and a-3,\u0027 and Martha burst into tears.\" Not a happy memory. The Dukes decided in subsequent years to skip the party at the Tournament House. It was a celebration. Often the Big Ten contingent didn\u0027t feel like celebrating. The Dukes would go back to the presidential suite at the Pasadena Hilton to spend the evening with Big Ten guests. Last season, when Michigan State beat USC, they again skipped the Tournament House celebration. It wouldn\u0027t look right to show up only after a victory. So the Dukes were back in their suite that evening, savoring a victory that, admittedly, was a \"blue collar win . . . a game we won after USC fumbled, but we\u0027d lost a lot of games that way\" when there was a knock at the door. \"All the Rose Bowl officers -- Harriman Cronk and all the rest -- came to bring me my Rose Bowl watch,\" Duke said. \"That was a highlight. They left their celebration to bring that to me, and I appreciated that.\" There were some points in their long relationship when some of the Rose Bowl folks were not too happy with Duke, when he sided with the movement to exclude the exclusivity clause from the Rose Bowl contract. Some feared that allowing Big Ten and Pac-10 teams to compete in other bowls, also, would dilute the impact of the Rose Bowl. Duke believed that the Rose Bowl, matching the champions of the conferences, would remain as strong as ever while letting more teams compete would be of benefit to both conferences. He was right, as usual. Over the last few years, Big Ten and Pac-10 schools have claimed an average of 40% of the total bowl pot of about $50 million. Duke points out that opening opportunities was good for parity in his conference, good for attendance, good for recruiting. \"When I had just been named commissioner of the Big Eight, and I was only 34 years old at the time, one of the first things I faced was the news that the Orange Bowl was terminating our exclusive contract,\" Duke said. \"They wanted to be able to invite the top teams, to have a \u0027national championship\u0027 game. \"Sports Illustrated wrote that the loss of that contract would be the death knoll of the Big Eight. Actually, it turned out to be a boon to the Big Eight. It opened up vistas for other bowls. We went to the Cotton Bowl, the Sugar Bowl and the Orange Bowl. It was great for our conference.\" Since the Rose Bowl changed its policy, and the Big Ten started to compete in other bowls in 1976, Big Ten schools have taken 56 bowl berths. Duke and his wife have been at a bowl game on New Year\u0027s Day for the last 26 years. They might attend a bowl game just for fun next year. Or they might not. If he\u0027s not at the Rose Bowl next year, he says he\u0027ll miss it. \"I\u0027ve been to most of the bowl games at one time or another,\" Duke said. \"I\u0027ve been to all the major bowls -- Orange, Cotton, Sugar. . . . And this is not to degrade any of the others. But I think the Rose Bowl is special.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE BOWL GAMES; COMMENTARY; FOOTBALL GIVES OKLAHOMA BLACK EYE This is a proposal for the governor of Oklahoma, the honorable Henry Bellmon. Roll up your sleeves, take a broom from the maintenance shed and, in one quick motion, sweep out the entire administration of the state university ... specifically the interim president, athletic director and football coach. Not under the rug, but out the door. It\u0027s particularly distressing that violations of recruiting rules have once again brought deep embarrassment to the school, its faculty and proud alumni. The University of Oklahoma has been slapped with a three-year probation for blatant disregard of the NCAA code. Too bad. There\u0027s something wrong in the thought process when Oklahoma puts such an emphasis on winning football games that it pays $1,000 to an athlete and provides an individual scalping service for varsity players so they can conveniently pocket the ticket money. If the governor isn\u0027t ashamed, then he\u0027s not conversant with what\u0027s going on in the state that elected him to provide proper guidance and supervision. It\u0027s personally distressing because we never met a man (or woman) from Oklahoma we didn\u0027t like. We once hitch-hiked from Tulsa to Claremore to visit the Will Rogers Museum in an effort to learn more about the old rope-spinning, yarn-telling cowboy philosopher. Our interest in Oklahoma has been so extensive that it resulted in the state\u0027s officially confirming upon us the title of \"Honorary Okie,\" with an actual certificate and button to go with it. Now Oklahoma, in a football way, has gone and inflicted injury to itself by drawing still another suspension. This is the fourth time the football program has been penalized in as many decades. How much longer is this type of despicable conduct going to continue? The violation shows Oklahoma has found still another way to disgrace itself. It\u0027s also reminiscent of what the former OU president, speaking facetiously, once said: \"We\u0027re going to build a university the football team can be proud of.\" Humorous or not, it\u0027s disgusting that education at Oklahoma is besmirched by what\u0027s going on in the hunt for prospects who can block and tackle. As for Coach Barry Switzer, the NCAA statement declared he \"failed to exercise supervisory control.\" It\u0027s as though he went out to lunch and stayed when the problems were occurring. The duty to conduct a clean operation belongs to him. If his assistants and office help were involved in illegal tactics, then he is the one who should be compelled to pay the penalty. If it was the military and something such as this happened, then the duty officer in charge would be brought up on allegations of incompetency and maybe even stripped of his commission. Switzer should be taking the rap for what has happened. How can he be held blameless? The governor should ask for his resignation by nightfall and advise him to take his services to Texas A\u0026M, Houston or SMU. The assessment of the charges, bringing severe discipline, tells the public Switzer doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s going on in his own shop, or coaching offices. It\u0027s time to assess Barry\u0027s value to Oklahoma. It would be within the bounds of the governor\u0027s authority to suggest Switzer clean out his desk and be off the parking lot before the band strikes up the refrain of \"Bye-Bye, Barry.\" It\u0027s obvious the transgressions need to be addressed from the governor\u0027s office and dealt with expeditiously. Oklahoma has been thrown for a severe loss. And what did the president, David Swank, who has the role on a temporary basis, say about it? He reacted by disclosing the university could lose between $750,000 and $1 million in each of the next two seasons. Athletic Director Donnie Duncan said, \"I think the way of summing up the way I feel is they wanted us and they got us.\" This is a play for sympathy, trying to paint a picture of the NCAA investigators as being biased against the Sooners. That\u0027s a cop-out. When one of the dominant football-playing universities in the land puts itself in this position, how can it permit the man it pays to head its football show to open his arms and say he didn\u0027t know what the men and women he hired were doing? There has to be a line of responsibility somewhere. And the man out in front leading the entire effort is the head coach, Switzer. Does he walk away while two assistant coaches, Mike Jones and Scott Hill, and a recruiting coordinator, Shirley Vaughan, who was removed from her job, are painted as scapegoats and burned at the goal post? Switzer is an adult and has been at Oklahoma for 16 years. He knows the burden is on his shoulders. The university should consider terminating his contract and suspending football for the next five years. This would demonstrate good faith and do wonders for reclaiming the clean and ethical reputation Oklahoma deserves to have.",

Thieves broke into Bryant Hall, the school\u0027s athletic dormitory, before Thursday night\u0027s game and stole about $2,000 worth of property belonging to 4 Alabama players, campus police said. Lt. Mark Shockley of the University Police Department said the thieves entered two rooms Thursday between 6 and 7 p.m., just before the beginning of the Crimson Tide\u0027s 80-65 victory over Northeast Louisiana. \"There were some electronic items stolen, some clothes, shoes and items of that nature,\" he said. Coach Wimp Sanderson said the thieves stole a television and video cassette recorder belonging to freshman Robert Horry. Another freshman, Marcus Webb, lost a gold watch and other items. \"Some of the guys lost clothes,\" Sanderson told the Tuscaloosa News. \"Some lost just about everything they had.\" Shockley said Bryant Hall \"appeared to have been open\" at the time of the heist. \"The rooms which they entered also appear to have been open,\" he added. \"Some other rooms appear to have been tampered with but we are not sure about that at this time.\" Sanderson said the thieves \"had to be . . . fairly familiar with the dorm. They would seem to have known where the basketball players live, when they would have been out of the dorm and they knew the football players and some of the staff were out of town for Christmas. The basketball players were the only ones who would have had things there.\" University police are investigating the crime, and Sanderson also is trying to help recover some of the stolen items. \"If there is anyone out there who knows how to help these guys get their things back, then I will post a reward,\" the coach said. \"We would really just like to recover their property.\"",

Pate would, of course, like the new year to be as rewarding as 1988. Winning early certainly eases any anxiety he might have as to how he\u0027s progressing. Pate, 27, who will defend his title in the Tournament of Champions starting Thursday at La Costa, has steadily advanced on the money list in his 4 years on the Tour. He earned $89,358 in 1985, $176,100 in 1986, $335,728 in 1987 and $582,473 in 1988. \"After that great start I was hoping to win more,\" Pate said. \"I guess I was a little greedy, but I had a good stretch at the end of the year even though I didn\u0027t win. Coming back to La Costa puts me in a winning frame of mind again.\" Asked if he has any long-term goals, the Simi Valley resident said: \"I\u0027d like to win every week but, obviously, that isn\u0027t going to happen. I\u0027d like to win more than once this year and defend one of my championships. \"I haven\u0027t made any major changes in my game, or mental approach. I\u0027m just getting better at it, like refining my swing. And I don\u0027t let bad things bother me.\" Pate says the T of C is the best quality field of the year. To qualify one must win a PGA Tour tournament, or the British Open in the 12 months since the last Tournament of Champions. And there\u0027s quite an attrition rate from year to year. Of the record 38 qualifiers in 1988, only 13 will return to shoot for the first prize of $135,000 and a total purse of $750,000. Pate, who finished 12th on the money list in 1988, played in 30 tour events in 1988. \"I\u0027m going to try to play less than 30 tournaments this year, but I hate to read about people making all that money while I\u0027m sitting at home.\" The Nabisco Championships last November at Pebble Beach paid Curtis Strange $360,000 for winning a playoff with Tom Kite. Asked if the Nabisco tournament unfairly tilts the money winning total, Pate said: \"I think it does. That it can swing that much in one week I don\u0027t think is particularly fair. But if I had to make a decision of not having the tournament, or having it, I\u0027d have it the way it is.\" Pate is sometimes confused by galleries with Jerry Pate, a former U.S. Open winner, whose career has been curtailed by injuries. Steve Pate takes it in stride. \"I don\u0027t think I look a whole like Jerry,\" \"A lot of people follow me because they think I\u0027m Jerry. In an offhand way it gives me more recognition. \"Some people even ask me about diving in a lake.\" Jerry Pate made a famous splash after winning the Tournament Players Championship in 1982 -- and the memory lingers on. As for Steve Pate, he might not be adverse to diving in a lake if he shoots consecutive rounds of 66 as he did last year on his way to winning the rain abbreviated T of C by a stroke over Larry Nelson. After he won last year, taking a check for $90,000, Pate said: \"I\u0027m not going to lie to you that I was disappointed that the last round was canceled. A win is a win. You take it any way you can.\" He has been sharp lately, shooting a 64 to tie the course record at Kapalua in Maui in the Kirin Cup competition. It was also a memorable year off the course for Pate. \"I was on the fifth hole playing in the Honda tournament when I got word that my wife, Sheri, was about ready to have our first child. I ran off the course, set a speed record driving to the Miami Airport and just missed the plane by 2 minutes,\" he said. \"I had to wait 4 hours for the next flight. \"In Los Angeles, I raced to the hospital from LAX and missed my daughter Nicole\u0027s birth by an hour. Fortunately, Sheri and Nicole came through in great shape, but I was a nervous wreck.\" Golf Notes Orel Hershiser, the Dodger Cy Young Award winner; New York Mets catcher Gary Carter and Julius (Dr. J) Irving, the former star forward for the Philadelphia 76ers, will be among celebrities in the 30th annual Bob Hope Chrysler Classic to be held Jan. 11-15 over four courses in the Palm Springs area.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition COMMENTARY; BENIRSCHKE HAS MASTERED HIS NEW JOB, DOWN TO THE LETTER Rolf Benirschke, the excellent former kicker for the San Diego Chargers, is going to be the new host of the daytime \"Wheel of Fortune.\" A bit of a surprise choice, wouldn\u0027t you say, considering that Rolf Benirschke is not exactly a household name -- unless you\u0027re in the Zendejas house. Really, let\u0027s say you\u0027re spinning the wheel, and the puzzle\u0027s a name, and B, N, R, S, C, H and K are already lit, and you buy the I and E. Now you\u0027re looking at the whole name, and you still can\u0027t place it or pronounce it, so you\u0027re thinking: It has to be a trick puzzle. \"Pat, I\u0027d like to buy an A.\" Last year in an interview, Vanna White was asked what tips she would give to Wheel wanna-bes, and she said, \"You have to know the whole alphabet.\" Of course! How stupid I was to think I could get away with stopping at S. The way Benirschke got the gig is pure Hollywood. He was a guest on an L.A. morning TV show, chatting about staying healthy -- you might remember Benirschke\u0027s near-fatal bout with ulcerative colitis -- and who should be watching the show but jaunty little rich guy Merv Griffin, creator of \"Wheel of Fortune.\" Merv was so taken by Benirschke, he offered him the host\u0027s job on \"Windfall,\" Merv\u0027s newest game show. According to Benirschke\u0027s assistant, Debbie Marshall, \"Merv conveyed this to Rolf: \u0027You\u0027re a genuine, sincere person who loves people, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m looking for.\u0027 \" Gosh darn it, that\u0027s what separates Merv from the pack, the ability to see all that in one guest shot. As well he should have been, Benirschke was slightly embarrassed. He hadn\u0027t gone to college and majored in zoology to be a game-show host. (Years ago I did a story on Rick Barry, who told me his ambition was to be a game-show host. He was the first real, live person to say that to me. Before that, I assumed game-show hosts were bionic Ken dolls.) But Benirschke agreed to do an audition. \"It was my illness jumping in,\" Benirschke said, explaining, \"Surviving my illness taught me how neat life really is, and that you should live it and enjoy all of its experiences and possibilities.\" Benirschke\u0027s audition was so impressive that Merv suggested he forget about \"Windfall\" entirely, and aim higher: at The Wheel. In all, 30 tried out for The Wheel, including Jimmy Connors. (Hard to believe Jimbo knows all 26 letters. He usually gets stuck on \"I\"; he must have gotten coaching.) Why Benirschke? This is a direct quote from Shannon Williams of Merv Griffin Productions: \"They liked his open and sincere quality. He was real sincere with Vanna. He looks good with Vanna -- that\u0027s very important -- they make a good look. (They make a good look?) Vanna likes him. And he understands the game.\" Excuse me, the people who don\u0027t understand the game, what stumps them, is it tricky consonants like J and V? Do they think the game is unfair, that it aims too high up the intelligentsia ladder? Some will ask if Rolf Benirschke was really the most qualified man to fill Pat Sajak\u0027s shoes. (We\u0027re talking gigantic shoes in game-show annal.) Merv liked him, and that\u0027s good enough for me. Don\u0027t laugh. Dan Quayle got to be vice president because George Bush liked him, and that was good enough for you. Come to think of it, Dan Quayle looks just like a game-show host. Anyway, what are the qualifications? The ability to spell his own name seems to overqualify Rolf Benirschke for \"Wheel of Fortune.\" Anybody can spell Vanna White. Well, that double-N might be too much for some people, but it\u0027s not like the only thing keeping if off PBS. A fine, bright and charitable fellow -- the NFL\u0027s \"Man of the Year\" in 1983 and co-chairman of the National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis -- Benirschke has maintained his sense of humor about his new job. The other day he was asked if it didn\u0027t feel a bit preposterous to be a game-show host, and he said, \"Obviously it does. My father (Dr. Kurt Benirschke) is an internationally known professor of pathology, a physician, an author, and his son is asking people: \u0027Do you want to buy a vowel?\u0027 \" In a sense, it\u0027s a breakthrough. Other athletes have become actors, such as Ed Marinaro, Mike Warren, Fred Dryer and Alex Karras. But game-show hosting is a whole new field for jocks to consider. Eddie (Silent Movie) Murray, for example. He\u0027s well suited for a non-verbal show like \"Win, Lose or Draw.\" Tommy Lasorda could guest-host, and they could change the name of the show to \"Win, Lose or Eat.\" Right now, who\u0027s in more \"Jeopardy\" than Jerry Tarkanian? \"The Newlywed Game\" is a natural for veterans Joe Montana or Hal Sutton. George Steinbrenner could host \"The Price Is Right,\" and yell out, \"Billy Martin, you sly boots, come on down . . . again!\" Mike and Robin absolutely have to co-host \"Love Connection.\" For \"The Dating Game,\" the leaders in the clubhouse are Wade (Mr. Polaroid) Boggs and Mark (Do You Think I\u0027m Sexy, Or Simply Stupid) Gastineau. So Rolf, good luck, we\u0027ll be watching. And remember, it\u0027s A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition BRILLIANCE ROUTINE FOR MARIO LEMIEUX Rob Brown, who resembles Benjamin Franklin and is almost as quotable, looked at the questioner as if he were some kind of heretic. \"Does ANYTHING Mario Lemieux do on the ice surprise me?\" Brown, 20, a Pittsburgh Penguins winger, said, repeating the question. \"People who only see him play once in a while may be shocked when they see Mario make some incredible move or score some unbelievable goal. But when you see him play all the time and he\u0027s on your team, you are not surprised. You are just thankful that you can expect his greatness.\" What Brown is describing is routine brilliance. Routine brilliance. Those two words aren\u0027t compatible, because there is nothing humdrum about greatness. But it is within the domain of night-in and night-out performance that Lemieux has risen to such a consistent level that even at 23 he is knocking on the door of immortality. It is difficult to describe this 6-foot-4, 215-pound skating octopus any other way. Lemieux\u0027s combination of size, reach, skill and strength handling the puck are unique. He\u0027s a playmaker with a feathery touch and field of vision second only to Wayne Gretzky. He can work free in front of the net and unleash a sniper\u0027s bullet a la Phil Esposito in his prime. And he uses what seems like 15-foot rubber arms to control the puck and the tempo of the game like no one else in NHL history. \"God only knows what\u0027s going to come from Mario Lemieux next,\" Edmonton\u0027s Craig Simpson said of his former Penguins teammate. \"When Gretzky broke 200 points and went on to set the record (215 points in 1985-86), everybody wondered if it would ever be broken,\" Hartford Whalers President and General Manager Emile Francis said. \"Forget in Gretzky\u0027s lifetime. Lemieux might do it while Wayne\u0027s still in his prime.\" Earlier in his NHL career, the critics complained the kid didn\u0027t care enough. He didn\u0027t have enough heart. He was two zones away while his team was on defense. He turned it on and off as his mood hit and, like the Penguins, folded down the stretch. All that has changed the past two years. \"Wayne Gretzky taught Mario how to win,\" said Mr. Hockey, Gordie Howe. \"In my mind, Mario became a hockey player at last year\u0027s Canada Cup. Before he was a talent, a great talent. But he was weak defensively and didn\u0027t seem to be involved at all times. Now, he\u0027s damn near as good a hockey player as Wayne is. \"And he can do things that Wayne isn\u0027t physically able to do. The way he uses those arms and his strength to control the puck when it\u0027s about five feet away from him is unbelievable. That big son of a gun is something else.\" As much as the Universal Gretzky Adoration Society does not want to admit it, the time has come when Lemieux perhaps should no longer be held in comparison to Gretzky. At this point, Gretzky probably should be compared to Lemieux. After being limited to one assist in a 2-2 tie in New Jersey on Friday, Lemieux entered Monday night\u0027s game against the Whalers at the Hartford Civic Center leading the NHL with 92 points (36 goals, 56 assists) in 33 games. If Lemieux doesn\u0027t miss any more games to injury, his 2.79-points-a-game pace would give him an NHL record 217 points. His goal pace is headed for 85, which would be second only to Gretzky\u0027s 92 goals in 1981-82. All those projections won\u0027t mean a hill of beans if Lemieux rips off another 41-point barrage like he did in the first 12 games of this season before missing a few games with a wrist injury. \"I want to win the scoring title, with Gretzky (82 points), Bernie Nicholls (83) and myself there\u0027s a challenge,\" Lemieux said. \"I want to be the best I can. But after a while all the Lemieux vs. Gretzky (comparisons) can get a little old. I\u0027m sure Wayne feels the same way. I really admire him. But I want to be recognized as Mario Lemieux and judged on what I can do.\" \"There\u0027s got to be some friendly competition between the two,\" Brown said. \"But Mario hears it so much. Wouldn\u0027t you get tired of it, too?\" The irony is that Gretzky served as a teacher in Lemieux\u0027s maturation process. Gretzky showed Lemieux the door to immortality, but Lemieux had to be the one to open it. At the 1987 Canada Cup, Lemieux played on Gretzky\u0027s wing. They pushed each other to a higher level. As Team Canada Coach Jean Perron said at the time, \"Buckle up because we\u0027re going into hockey space.\" The two complemented each other. They challenged each other. Much of it was done not in words, but in the reflex actions of peerless talents. Lemieux scored 11 goals in nine games. Gretzky assisted on nine of them. For purists, the three-game Canada Cup series against the Soviets may well have been the greatest hockey ever played. And the riveting overtime thriller in Game 2 at Hamilton may have been the greatest single game in hockey history. Lemieux won it. Gretzky assisted. In the final minute of the decisive third game, Canada broke the deadlock. Goal Lemieux. Assist Gretzky. Match to Canada. \"There is no denying how much winning at the Canada Cup meant to me,\" Lemieux said, criticized in the past for turning down invitations to the world championships after Pittsburgh had failed to make the NHL playoffs. \"Wayne was terrific. It gave me confidence that I could play with the best in the world.\" Howe is big buddies with Gretzky. It would be a major upset for him to admit publicly that Lemieux is better. But others have said it. \"Right now, Mario Lemieux is the best player in the world,\" Detroit Coach Jacques Demers said. A Lemieux vs. Gretzky poll in the Whalers\u0027 locker room earlier this season showed that more players believed Lemieux\u0027s talent was No. 1, but that they\u0027d still want Gretzky when it mattered most. Mike Liut said you don\u0027t surpass Gretzky. You can only match him. Brent Peterson said, \"For the regular season, I\u0027d take Lemieux. For the playoffs, I\u0027d take Gretzky.\" Lemieux cannot be shocked by such talk.

He and his teammates were more than happy to deliver. \"People didn\u0027t just want us to beat them,\" Holden said. \"They wanted us to blow them out.\" It might not have been a blowout, but the No. 14-ranked Cardinals used a balanced scoring attack and their superior depth to score a decisive 97-75 victory at Louisville\u0027s Freedom Hall. Louisville had not beaten Kentucky since a 71-64 victory in Freedom Hall Dec. 15, 1984. The Wildcats, who had won the last 3 meetings, still hold a 14-6 series advantage. \"The victory is a step in the right direction because we finished December undefeated,\" said Pervis Ellison, who led Louisville with 20 points. Louisville\u0027s reserves, paced by Everick Sullivan with 15 points, outscored Kentucky\u0027s reserves, 31-3, as the Cardinals (7-2) won their seventh straight game. Louisville Coach Denny Crum said his ability to send in fresh players at will forced Kentucky (5-7) into an up-tempo game. \"The most important thing we wanted them to do was to run and shoot in an up-tempo game,\" Crum said. \"We took advantage of our depth and got good play off our bench.\" Consecutive 3-point shots by Derrick Miller pulled Kentucky to within 54-43 with 1:43 left, but Louisville scored 11 of the next 14 points to put the game out of reach, 65-46, at the 11:20 mark. Kentucky never got closer than 12. Miller led Kentucky with 34 points, including 5 3-pointers. Freshman scored 13 points for the Wildcats. Missouri 96, Morgan State 66 -- Lee Coward scored 7 points and Gary Leonard added 4 during a 20-2 run that gave the Tigers a 36-13 lead with 5:18 remaining in the first half, and No. 11 Missouri went on to rout the Bears at Columbia, Mo. Leonard, a senior center whose previous career high was 17 points, led the Tigers (12-3) with 23. Morgan State\u0027s James McCoy led all scorers with 27 points. Morgan State (4-5) was outrebounded, 44-28. Arkansas Little Rock 89, Marshall 79 -- Johnnie Bell scored 20 points and had 13 rebounds to lead the Trojans past the Thundering Herd in the championship game of the Arkansas Little Rock tournament at Little Rock, Ark. The Trojans were ahead, 66-50, with 11 minutes left when Marshall mounted a comeback to pull within 82-76 with 1:29 to play. Oregon State 72, Clemson 58 -- The victory at Portland late Friday night gave the Beavers their second straight Far West tournament title. It was their 17th title in the tournament\u0027s 33-year history. The championship also was the seventh for Ralph Miller in his 19 seasons at Oregon State. Miller, 69, is retiring at the end of this season. Oregon State (7-3) took the lead for good at 44-41 with 15:40 to play on one of Gary Payton\u0027s 4 3-point shots. The basket started an 18-9 run that gave the Beavers a 59-50 lead on another Payton 3-pointer with 7:26 left. Payton, a junior guard, scored 18 points, had 7 assists and was named the tournament MVP. The Tigers are 7-2. Illinois 96, Hawaii 87 -- Senior guard Kenny Battle scored a career-high 29 points and Nick Anderson added 26 as the No. 4 Illini remained unbeaten at 12-0 by winning the Rainbow tournament late Friday night at Honolulu. With 14:06 remaining in the game, Chris Gaines gave Hawaii a 60-58 lead when he scored on a fast-break layup. Anderson, who scored 18 of his points in the second half, then made a 3-point play with 13:48 to go, giving Illinois a lead it never relinquished. Hawaii (7-4), which lost its first home game, was led by Reggie Cross with 24 points. No. 17 Georgia Tech beat Purdue, 72-69, for third place.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition STEROID REPORT A REVELATION TO CIF HIERARCHY; \u0027EPIDEMIC\u0027 SURPRISES ADMINISTRATORS, COACHES The heads of 2 commissions that oversee athletics in all public high schools in Southern California said that they were surprised by the findings of a recent national survey indicating that 1 of every 15 boys in 12th grade has used anabolic steroids. Both said that they have never received a report of a student using the muscle-building drug. But a national expert on drug abuse said that steroid use among high school students is rising sharply and is at epidemic levels in some Southern California communities. \"It\u0027s a frightening situation,\" said Dr. Forest S. Tennant of West Covina, a leader in the treatment of substance abuse. Tennant has treated many professional athletes for cocaine dependency, including former Dodger pitcher Steve Howe and NBA star Walter Davis. \"I have seen blood-test results from users of anabolic steroids. I have been shocked to see the dramatic effects they have on the human body.\" Tennant, who operates a drug abuse treatment center in Van Nuys, said that his studies have shown steroids to have a dramatic impact on the adrenal gland and the immune system and to cause cholesterol levels to soar in most users. A study published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., purported to be the first nationwide survey of steroid use among high school boys, found that of the 3,403 seniors interviewed at 46 schools, 6.6% of them said that they were using or had used steroids. Most said that they took the drug to enhance their athletic performance, but 26.7% were non-athletes who said that they used steroids to build muscles and improve their physical appearance. Stan Thomas, the commissioner of the of the California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section -- which oversees more than 500 schools -- said that his organization has never had a report of steroid use by a local high school athlete. \"None. Not a single report,\" Thomas said. \"But I am certain it goes on. It\u0027s like marijuana use in your high school. You\u0027d be crazy to say it doesn\u0027t go on. It\u0027s the same thing with steroids. \"But I am just overwhelmed to hear those numbers. The numbers are scary.\" Hal Harkness, the director of interscholastic athletics for the City Section -- which oversees 49 Los Angeles School District programs -- said that he knows of no incidents involving steroid use by athletes in city schools. \"I have had no calls about it, ever,\" he said. \"I have heard absolutely no comments in over two years in this position from anyone in our schools regarding steroids.\" Tennant said that the reason for the lack of reports on steroid use by students is that coaches and administrators don\u0027t know what they\u0027re looking for. \"If they are waiting to get reports on steroid use like they get reports of kids using marijuana or cocaine, then they will never get any reports,\" Tennant said. \"Steroids are not taken in that manner, at lunchtime or at smoke break at school. Steroids are taken in a very programmed way, at a very intentional time and place, most likely away from the school. Users of cocaine and marijuana take those drugs when they are passed to them.\" The study reported that more than one-third of the seniors who said they have taken steroids took them both orally and by injection. Only one-fifth of those who claimed to use steroids said they got the drugs from a health-care professional. The majority obtained the steroids from other athletes, coaches and people who frequent gyms, the study said. Tennant said that he began to see widespread steroid use among adolescents 4 years ago. \"The figures in the national study just released are not only believable, but in Southern California I think they are higher than that,\" he said. \"It is spotty. In some communities people have never seen or heard about anabolic steroids. In others, it\u0027s an epidemic. As long as four years ago, I had substantiated reports of parents and coaches giving steroids to Little League baseball players and Pop Warner football players. \"This study is a validation of something I have seen for the last four years. I support what it said and I agree with its findings.\" Tennant was especially alarmed at the reasons some steroid users gave for taking the drug. \"The most frightening aspect of steroid use is that adolescents are using them to alter their basic physical appearance,\" he said. \"They perceive that doing that will make them more sexually attractive or give them some success in life that they can\u0027t achieve otherwise. It symbolizes something that has gone sour in our society, that our natural body and our natural talents are not worthy anymore.\" Bill Redell, a veteran high school football coach who recently resigned from his post at Crespi High, said that he encountered only 1 player at Crespi whom he suspected of using steroids. But he said that the results of the national study are not unexpected. \"It didn\u0027t surprise me a bit to see those numbers,\" said Redell, who also played and coached in the defunct U. S. Football League. \"The pressure on the kids today to win, and to perform well, is greater than ever. There are parents who pressure their own kids into taking steroids, not only not condemning steroid use but actually encouraging it. The pressure is to gain major college scholarships.\" Canyon High Coach Harry Welch, who has run the Valley-area\u0027s most successful football program for the past 7 years, said that he has never encountered steroid use among his players. \"We discuss drugs but I haven\u0027t discussed steroids because I\u0027ve never seen the need,\" he said. Welch added that he condemns steroid use, equating it with so-called recreational drugs. \"It really scares me,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve read that it affects the reproductive system. To even flirt with using something that could affect your sexual identity or the future of your children . . . I would condemn it in the harshest way.\" Cleveland High Coach Steve Landress found it difficult to believe the statistics, saying that he has never heard of high school athletes -- or students -- using steroids during his 13 years of coaching. He especially ruled out athletes, saying top players have no need for such drugs at the high school level. \"Guys who are Division I-type players are so much better than other players they don\u0027t need it,\" he said. \"Even a few years ago when it wasn\u0027t such a big thing to say you used steroids, I never heard anyone talk about it.\" Thomas said that the Southern Section has never discussed the issue of steroids with coaches and has never sent memos to coaches informing them of indications of steroid use by players. \"I guess we felt it should be common sense,\" Thomas said. \"If a kid goes from 165 pounds to 205 pounds in six months, a coach should have a clue that steroids might be involved. I guess we assumed they would know. But I\u0027m not satisfied anymore with where we are with this issue. We have to do more.\" Thomas, however, said that the Southern Section has no firm plan to deal with steroid use. He said that the organization is involved in an educational program sponsored by the Los Angeles Amateur Athletic Foundation and is participating in another steroid awareness program sponsored by the Orange County Sheriff\u0027s Deparment. \"We have run articles about steroid use in our football game programs,\" Thomas said. Testing players for steroids has never been seriously considered, he said. \"I honestly have to admit we have been remiss in the world of drug abuse,\" Thomas said. \"Drugs are a problem in our high schools in general, but the CIF Southern Section should take a leadership role (against) drug abuse, including the use of steroids.\" Harkness said that the City Section may implement a steroid awareness program early next year. There will be no drug testing, however. \"We will not even consider voluntary drug testing,\" he said. \"To begin with, voluntary testing is not effective. Those individuals who even think they might test positively for steroids simply won\u0027t volunteer for the testing. And mandatory testing is absolutely out of the question. We just don\u0027t have the right to do that and it wouldn\u0027t even be considered.\" Tennant said that the solution is a massive and immediate educational program. \"The educational pitch is simple,\" he said. \"No. 1, sports are here only to spend a little time in your young years competing, learning team spirit and discipline and fitness and competition. Anabolic steroids just don\u0027t have a place in that. They don\u0027t belong, and don\u0027t use them. Ever. They will hurt you. \"And we have to repeat that message to our kids, over and over. Repetition. That\u0027s how we got people to wear seat belts and to brush their teeth and to lose weight. You keep giving them this message, again and again: Don\u0027t use steroids.\"",

That is the answer, which comes without hesitation, from Western State Conference basketball coaches asked to name the favorites in this season\u0027s race for the WSC title. \"Those two are head and shoulders above everyone else in the conference talent-wise,\" Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. \"Everybody else is right there together.\" Santa Monica and Ventura shared the championship last season with 11-2 records, and no one affiliated with the conference is bold enough to predict that it might not be a similar scenario this time around. The WSC has been slightly realigned after the defection of Allan Hancock College to the Central Valley Conference and the entry of Valley and West Los Angeles. Valley, which played in the Southern California Conference last season, and West L. A. will join the South Division, which also includes Santa Monica, Canyons, Glendale and Bakersfield. The North Division comprises Ventura, Moorpark, Cuesta, Santa Barbara and Oxnard. Santa Monica Coach John McMullen grudgingly admits that his Corsairs may be the team to beat. \"I suppose on our preseason record and returning lettermen that\u0027s the case,\" said McMullen, whose team is 15-3 and has won the Rancho Santiago, Compton, Merced and Pasadena tournaments. \"If that\u0027s true, we\u0027re not that far ahead of anybody else. I\u0027ve seen Valley, Canyons, Moorpark and Glendale, and they\u0027re all competitive.\" Indeed, all of the Valley-area teams have tasted success during the preconference schedule. Canyons (9-8), though plagued by inconsistency, has looked spectacular at times. The Cougars finished 8-5 in the WSC last season and made the playoffs for the fourth year in a row. This season, they finished second in the Glendale tournament. Lee Smelser, in his 20th season as coach at Canyons, said the WSC likely will be one of the best conferences in the state. Whether his team will be among the best in the conference, however, will depend on its ability to eliminate mistakes. \"We\u0027re in a manner of transition, trying to be halfway decent and struggling,\" said Smelser, whose team opens WSC play Tuesday at West L. A. \"We haven\u0027t been able to put the whole package together. That\u0027s been kind of frustrating.\" For a variety of reasons, Glendale (9-6) lost 4 players -- potentially, a strong nucleus -- from a young team that finished 6-7 in the WSC last season. The Vaqueros, who open WSC play Wednesday at Santa Monica, are once again a young outfit, but the team has shown steady improvement despite its youth. \"We\u0027re doing all right considering what happened,\" said Beauchemin, who is in his 10th season with the Vaqueros. \"The players are starting to respond.\" Valley (10-6), which joins the WSC after competing in the Southern California Conference, has a talented team led by center Oral Elrington and could give some teams trouble if the Monarchs are able to develop depth. Valley\u0027s first test comes Wednesday at Bakersfield. Moorpark (8-7 entering the weekend), though dominated by freshmen, should improve steadily under Al Nordquist, who is in his 22nd season with the Raiders. Point guard Roger Thomas, a freshman from Leuzinger High, is averaging 10.9 points a game to lead the Raiders. Moorpark opens its conference schedule Wednesday at home against Cuesta. Oxnard, which finished 1-12 last season, is the most improved team in the WSC. Santa Barbara won its own tournament and also is considered a conference dark horse. But in a conference with Santa Monica and Ventura, every team is a long-shot to displace the reigning co-champions. Ventura (13-2 entering the weekend) might have lost conference MVP Cedric Ceballos, but the Pirates have been buoyed by the play of all-conference point guard Tony Walker, who is averaging 9.6 assists, and freshman forward Reggie Betton, who is averaging 13.9 points. Ventura, which opens WSC play Wednesday at Santa Barbara, has won the Cypress and Ventura tournaments. Santa Monica has 7 players back from a team that lost to Merced in the quarterfinals of the state tournament last season, including All-WSC forward Keith Amerson, forwards Von Shuler and Kemo Patrick and guards DeShawn Pullard and Troy Batiste, all of whom average more than 10 points. \"It looks to me as if this is one of the strongest conferences overall in Southern California,\" McMullen said. \"I feel that everybody has a team that can beat anybody else on a given night.\"",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition FACES TO WATCH NEXT SEASON: HIGH SCHOOLS Chris Alexander, Hawthorne track -- The state\u0027s dominant track team continues to produce blue-chip talent. The latest could be Alexander, who was on the state champion relays last June as a freshman. He also plays football, but a broken arm ended his season early. Piper Hahn and Kristal Attwood, Mira Costa volleyball -- Mira Costa bowed out in the CIF 5-A finals, but then this was a rebuilding year with an entirely underclass lineup. Hahn figures to be one of the top prep players in the nation next year, with Attwood not far behind. Steve Clover, Rolling Hills basketball -- The junior guard has blossomed into one of the Southland\u0027s top 3-point shooters and will be a coveted college recruit next year when he will be out of John Hardy\u0027s shadow. Lisa Leslie, Morningside basketball -- College coaches will have to wait for the next dominating center, because she\u0027ll only be a high school senior next year. The 6-foot-5 Monarch is already rated in the top handful of female players in the nation. Nkosi Littleton, Carson football -- The Colts\u0027 all-star defensive tackle may be the most athletic lineman around next year. The only non-senior on the All-City first team, the 6-2, 210-pound junior is also one of the school\u0027s best basketball players. John Ma\u0027ae and Derek Sparks, Banning football -- Opponents have to cringe at the thought of quarterback Ma\u0027ae, who will be a three-year starter, handing off to the powerful running back Sparks, who emerged this year as a sophomore. COMMUNITY COLLEGES Marcel Bridges, Harbor College football -- It was difficult for a receiver to stand out in Harbor\u0027s offense, but the talented freshman earned all-conference honors and all-state honorable mention. Now if the Seahawks can only find a quarterback. . . . Frank Dolce, El Camino College football -- El Camino has been \"Quarterbacks R Us\" for most of the decade, and Dolce will return with some impressive stats. Most impressive -- he led the Warriors to their second straight PONY Bowl title. Raul Haro, El Camino College soccer -- The L.A. high school player of the year wasted no time establishing himself on the community college level, leading the Warriors to the Southern California Conference title while earning SCC Player of the Year honors. UNIVERSITIES Devon Akita, Dominguez Hills volleyball/basketball -- Two programs trying to establish themselves are counting on the 5-7 sophomore. She may have the talent to earn all-conference honors in both sports. Robert Barksdale, Dominguez Hills basketball -- In Dick Vitale slang, the Toro sophomore guard is a \"Dow Joneser\" -- up and down. But by the time he\u0027s a senior the 6-foot-1 Barksdale could be the best shooting point guard in school history. Miah Bradbury, Mike McNary and Tim Williams, Loyola Marymount baseball -- The Lions have had a string of All-Americans in recent years, and this trio is bidding to join them. Bradbury, a strong-armed, heavy-hitting catcher, was one of the hitting stars of the NCAA Regionals last spring. McNary, a poised sophomore right-hander, toils in lefty Steve Surico\u0027s shadow but figures to be a staff mainstay. Line drives jump off the bat of Williams, also a sophomore, who is looking for a home either at first or in the outfield. Chuck Donlon, Loyola Marymount volleyball -- The Lions\u0027 men\u0027s team is trying to turn the corner, and Donlon may be the cornerstone in becoming more competitive. The 6-6 sophomore may be Loyola\u0027s best player since Olympian Paul Sunderland in the 1970s. Joe Flanagan, Dominguez Hills soccer -- The Toro forward was outshined this year by the scoring of transfer Willie Ayala -- who also returns -- but Flanagan figures to end his senior year leading the Toros in virtually every career offensive category. Terrell Lowery, Loyola Marymount basketball -- Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer figure to be filling up the basket again next season, but the key man in Paul Westhead\u0027s offense is the point guard, and the slender freshman figures to be the one getting them the ball. Kristi White, Dominguez Hills soccer -- The midfielder has earned post-season honors for the Toros, but Coach Marine Cano is still waiting for her to develop the scoring touch he anticipated. If she blossoms as a senior, the Toros could have a devastating attack. ALAN DROOZ",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition COLLEGE CATALOG; GRANADA HILLS SCOUT RATES FOOTBALL PROSPECTS TO PROVIDE SHOPPING ASSISTANCE BY THE NUMBERS Foster Andersen at a high school football game: He draws a bead on an offensive lineman\u0027s feet. Are they quick feet? Or slow feet? Then he focuses on a defensive back\u0027s hips. How fast can they switch gears from forward to reverse? Next, he zeroes in on a receiver\u0027s hands. Soft or hard? And the quarterback\u0027s arm. How strong? To Andersen, winning isn\u0027t everything, anatomy is. Every week during the football season, he sees a minimum of 3 high school and 2 junior college games. He doesn\u0027t care about results. He doesn\u0027t root. He just scrutinizes hands and feet and hips and arms and puts all the body parts together to form a well-rounded opinion of a player. As the owner of Sports Search, a scouting service he runs out of his Granada Hills home, Andersen judges football prospects and sells his evaluations to major colleges such as USC, UCLA and Miami. This past season, he and 2 associates analyzed the college potential of 400 high school and 400 junior college players in the vast football caldron of Southern California. That\u0027s a lot of body parts. \"But I never get tired of going to games,\" says Andersen, 48, a two-way lineman for UCLA in the early 1960s and former head coach at Cal State L. A. \"It\u0027s the parking that bugs me.\" Scouting services such as Andersen\u0027s are in vogue -- USC subscribes to about 50 -- because the NCAA has tightened the screws on recruiting. As of this year, colleges cannot even scout a prospect until Nov. 1. To cover ground quickly and thoroughly, they buy reports from scouting services, which rate the best players. Andersen sells his service for as much as $800 a year for voluminous compilations or as little as $75 for, say, a breakdown on quarterbacks. \"Our reports allow a college staff to prioritize its time,\" Andersen says. \"We tell them who they should concentrate on and who\u0027s a waste of time.\" The fear of missing a blue-chip player also drives colleges to subscribe to scouting services. \"We cross-reference players rated by the various services,\" says USC recruiting coordinator Jack Himebauch. Andersen assigns a rating to each player he scouts. The best is a 1+, which represents \"the guys I\u0027d want if I were coach at USC or UCLA,\" he says. Players rated as a 1 or 1- are Division I caliber. A 2+ would be the best player available for Division II schools. Of the 400 high school players he has evaluated this year, \"150 are capable of playing in Division I and maybe 30 are rated 1+,\" he says. But his ratings are not chiseled in stone. Colleges use scouting services as an aid, not a directive, often disagreeing with or ignoring their recommendations. \"Coaches still make their own evaluations,\" Himebauch says. \"They don\u0027t rely on somebody else\u0027s opinion to offer a player a scholarship.\" Last year, Andersen says he was pushing Jack Swan of El Camino Royal High as \"the best offensive lineman in the Valley.\" But neither USC nor UCLA recruited him, Andersen says, because at 6-3, he was shorter than their prototype lineman. But one of Sports Search\u0027s subscribers, the University of Georgia, gave Swan a scholarship and \"think they stole him out of Southern California,\" Andersen says. Andersen puts all his information in an IBM computer in the family room of his ranch house. Players are listed alphabetically and by position. Aside from ratings, Andersen includes capsule comments on each player, \"little bits of information coaches like.\" Typing on the computer keyboard -- \"I had to learn to type to go into this business,\" he says -- Andersen called up Hart High tight end Brian Allen. The comment read: \"Catches with hands. Doesn\u0027t look like he\u0027ll fill out for different positions because of body type.\" Andersen explained, \"Coaches don\u0027t necessarily like receivers who catch the ball against their pads, and they also want to know if a prospect has the potential to play other positions,\" such as offensive or defensive line. In the analysis of Crespi running back Russell White, Andersen mentioned that he could also be \"a great defensive back.\" White, of course, got Andersen\u0027s highest rating despite nagging injuries and a \"weak offensive line\" this season. \"I watched him in practice,\" Andersen says, \"and his work ethic is very, very good.\" But who is the best back in the L. A. area? Andersen likes Hawthorne quarterback Curtis Conway, projecting him as a college tailback. Andersen\u0027s computer comment says Conway \"may be the next Marcus Allen.\" An assistant coach at USC under Ted Tollner, Andersen was out of a job when Larry Smith brought in his own assistants 2 years ago. So Andersen, along with computer expert Dick Laugens, started Sports Search, hiring former USC assistants Larry Bryan and Nate Shaw to help with the scouting. They specialize in Southern California players \"because California supplies 15% of the players in Division I,\" Andersen says. Andersen has opinions on where to find the best players in the area. \"Banning and Carson have the premier concentration of athletes in public schools,\" he says. \"In private schools, it\u0027s Loyola and Crespi. They have good coaches and an administration that wants football to be a unifying force on campus.\" Andersen says that San Fernando High has the best talent in the Valley this year and Orange County \"is where you\u0027ll find the great linemen.\" Inner-city schools, he says, \"traditionally produce great running backs and receivers.\" Andersen sometimes disagrees with all-star teams, which he says are based on \"politics.\" For instance, the Golden League put defensive lineman Sean McCune of Canyon High on its second team. \"I think he\u0027d leave some of the first team in the dirt,\" Andersen says. He gave Granada Hills defensive lineman Anthony Hall a 1+ but Hall didn\u0027t make All-North Valley League. Although the 1988 season is behind him, Andersen will not be taking it easy until the fall. Scouting is a full-time, year-round job. \"We\u0027re working on our spring list -- juniors in high school,\" he says. So he will be attending spring practices -- and watching lots of body parts.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition THE YEAR IN REVIEW; A LOOK AHEAD, BEHIND; MANY STRUGGLED THROUGH \u002788, BUT NEAR YEAR OFFERS HOPE; PADRES With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. Seven reasons the Padres\u0027 1989 season will be different from 1988: 1. They won\u0027t have to worry about a club president making an obscene gesture to the fans on Fan Appreciation Night. First, the Padres no longer have a club president. Chub Feeney resigned last fall within hours of wagging an obscene right-hand gesture at some heckling fans. Second, Feeney has reportedly moved back to the comforts of San Francisco, where his gesture is the social equivalent of a handshake. Third, if club officials are smart, they will hold this year\u0027s fan appreciation activities during an afternoon game. Even if Feeney chooses to fly down for an encore, he\u0027ll probably be napping at that hour if last year\u0027s routine is any indication. 2. They won\u0027t have to worry about a manager engaging in a fist fight with any players. Larry Bowa is gone. Stanley Jefferson is gone. And the last person dumb enough to mess with Jack McKeon, Bowa\u0027s replacement, still has the cigar burns to prove it. 3. They won\u0027t have to worry about firing a manager at 7 a.m. It worked with Bowa, who was canned on May 28 in New York while still in his pajamas. But it won\u0027t work with McKeon. Virtually every day on the road at 7 a.m., he\u0027s in church. Considering the erratic history of Padre management, that\u0027s not a bad idea. 4. They won\u0027t have to worry about losing a starting third baseman for 3 days with a bruised tooth root. Chris Brown is gone. Come to think of it, the Padres also won\u0027t have to worry about losing a starting third baseman for a week because he twisted his heel walking off the field. Or worry about losing a starting third baseman for a week because he hurt his thumb sucker-punching one of the club\u0027s reserve outfielders (Marvell Wynne). Or worry about losing a starting third baseman for 5 minutes during the middle of the game because of a broken jockstrap. Where did Chris Brown go? Does it matter? 5. They won\u0027t have to worry about their home-run hitter turning a cartwheel after a home run. Keith Moreland is gone, having been shipped with Brown to Detroit. In Detroit, the players turn cartwheels following every home run, delighted that they have just trotted 360 feet in public without being shot. The Padres\u0027 new home run hitter, Jack Clark, turned his first and last cartwheel when he found he was being traded here from the New York Yankees. Jack McKeon was dumb enough to try a cartwheel just once, and he has the cigar burns to prove it. 6. They won\u0027t have to worry about any frustrated manager or fan wanting to tear Jimmy Jones\u0027 face off. The mild-mannered and erratic starting pitcher has been traded to the New York Yankees. The latest New York Post insta-poll says his face won\u0027t make it to the All-Star break. 7. They won\u0027t have to worry about pitcher Andy Hawkins\u0027 shoulder. Hawkins became a free agent and signed with the New York Yankees for about double what he would have been paid in San Diego, partially because the Padres were worried about a right shoulder that caused him trouble in 1987 and may have hindered him late in 1988. In his first press conference as a Yankee, he said he was looking forward to moving out of San Diego and settling his wife and family in New York. The Yankees aren\u0027t worried about his shoulder -- they are worried about his head. BILL PLASCHKE",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition THE YEAR IN REVIEW; A LOOK AHEAD, BEHIND; MANY STRUGGLED THROUGH \u002788, BUT NEAR YEAR OFFERS HOPE; AMERICA\u0027S CUP With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. Seven reasons why the 1988 America\u0027s Cup defense was a farce: 1. It did not occur to New Zealand\u0027s Michael Fay that Stars \u0026 Stripes would be a catamaran. New Zealand had made its surprise challenge in a 90-foot monohull in July 1987, assuming Sail America would respond in kind. The Kiwi challenge, based on a literal interpretation of the America\u0027s Cup Deed of Gift, was upheld in the New York Supreme Court in November 1987. But the same literal interpretation of the Deed of Gift caused Sail America to respond with the catamaran. 2. San Diego, home of the San Diego Yacht Club, was left hanging for months on whether the 1988 races would be held off the San Diego coast. At one point, the City of San Diego was actually rebuffed in court in an attempt to assert its right to be a party to the competition. Indeed, on Jan. 22, Sail America announced that the races would be held off either Long Beach or Hawaii. In March, Sail America finally announced that the races would be off the San Diego coast in September. 3. Michael Fay complained about Stars \u0026 Stripes\u0027 commercialism. Responding to the Marlboro logo on Stars \u0026 Stripes, New Zealand hoisted a sail that said: \"Surgeon General\u0027s Warning: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health\" in the days leading up to the first race. Curiously, Stars \u0026 Stripes skipper Dennis Conner was race commodore for an American Cancer Society regatta. 4. Michael Fay whined and complained about how horrible this mismatch was going to be. For months and months, he complained. Encountering a couple of women bicyclists near the Kiwi compound, he said: \"Do you ladies know what this race will be like? Why, it will be like you two racing your bicycles against motorbikes.\" Just before the racing, Fay announced the results of a Kiwi-commissioned Gallup Poll which concluded that 53% of Americans thought the race was unfair. He did not make a big issue of the fact that 51% of Americans polled were unaware of any such controversy. 5. The races were horrible mismatches. Stars \u0026 Stripes won the first race by 18 minutes 15 seconds on Sept. 7 and concluded a sweep of the best-of-three series with a 21-minute 10-second victory 2 days later. 6. Sportsmanship was as horrible as the competition. The Kiwis accused Conner of intentionally sandbagging to keep the margin of victory from being even greater than it was. \"I consider what they did to be disgraceful,\" skipper David Barnes said. \"They should have gone out there and beaten us by 1 1/2 to 2 hours,\" designer Bruce Farr said. That was after the first race. After the second race, a press conference turned into a literal and verbal shoving match with grown men called each other liars and losers. 7. It\u0027s not over. Naturally, Michael Fay went back to the New York Supreme Court to ask that the race be forfeited to New Zealand because of how unfair it was that his monohull had to race against a catamaran. Presumably, the outcome of this continuing legal hassle will provide a farcical beginning to 1989. DAVE DISTEL",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition THE YEAR IN REVIEW; A LOOK AHEAD, BEHIND; MANY STRUGGLED THROUGH \u002788, BUT NEAR YEAR OFFERS HOPE; SOCKERS With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. Six steps that made the Sockers\u0027 spring and summer seem like a walk through the Twilight Zone, or the Museum of the Hard-To-Believe: 1. There\u0027s a sign post up ahead, and your next stop is ... The first indication this would not be a typical year came April 25. Ron Fowler, the chairman of Sockers\u0027 Management Inc., filed for protection from creditors in a Federal Bankruptcy Court under Chapter 11. This action came despite the Sockers\u0027 status as one of the most successful franchises in league history. 2. They come back, but Segota goes. In Game 7 of the Western Division finals on May 28, Branko Segota, the Sockers\u0027 leading scorer, injured his shoulder and was lost for the remainder of the playoffs. The Sockers advanced to the MISL Championship Series against the Cleveland Force without him, beating the Kansas City Comets, 8-5. There was a sign the Kansas City series would be bizarre in Game 3, when the Sockers blew a 6-1 lead in the fourth quarter and lost in overtime, 7-6. Kansas City had a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series before the Sockers rallied. 3. Break up the Sockers. The great all-star Sockers team of the 1980s played its last game together on June 7 and produced a 7-4 victory over Cleveland, wrapping up a four-game sweep of the MISL Championship Series and a sixth title in seven years. Because of salary cutbacks, it was apparent that players such as Segota, Juli Veee, Hugo Perez, Kevin Crow, Fernando Clavijo, Zoltan Toth and Jim Gorsek would not all be able to come back for another season. But Cleveland saw the Sockers at their best in the final game. Waad Hirmez notched a hat trick, and Perez broke a 4-4 tie with 3:34 remaining. 4. Fowler makes his bid ... After it became obvious that nobody else was interested in buying the franchise, Fowler announced an offer to buy it out of bankruptcy for $825,000 on June 17. Fowler\u0027s bid was eventually lowered to $470,000. He will also threatened to withdraw it on June 29. 5. . . . but on second thought . . . On the morning of July 8, Fowler arrived in court and was told by local reporter that the Tacoma Stars and Chicago Sting had folded, leaving the league with seven franchises. Fowler, who maintained all along that the league must have at least eight franchises to exist, called a press conference that afternoon and announced that soccer in San Diego was pretty much dead. Less than a week later, a group in Tacoma announced that it was going to try and re-start the Stars. So Fowler kept his offer alive. Tacoma was eventually re-started, but Cleveland folded on July 22. After a weekend\u0027s worth of meetings, the league decided to try another season with seven teams. Fowler, who had come this far, elected to stick it out, and his second bid is accepted by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter W. Bowie on July 29. 6. Back to soccer. On Nov. 5, after the team\u0027s most tumultuous off-season, the Sockers opened their 1988-89 season against the Los Angeles Lazers. Gone were Gorsek, Hirmez, Veee, Perez, Clavijo, Brian Schmetzer, Raffaele Ruotolo and Jacques Ladouceur. As if to put on exclamation point on the summer\u0027s activities, ex-Sockers Hirmez and Gorsek led the Lazers to a 5-2 victory. On Nov. 22, the Sockers signed Steve Zungul, the top scorer in the history of the game. Reunited with Segota, Zungul goes on a scoring spree (six goals in his first six games) and the Sockers are 7-7 going into the New Year. CHRIS ELLO",

Everything else you wanted to know about but were afraid to ask: 1. A Pair for Pate. Steve Pate thought San Diego was a great golf town. On windy Sunday Jan. 17, after three delays because of rain and one because of hail, the Tournament of Champions was called off, and Pate was declared the winner after 54 holes at La Costa. Pate was awarded the $90,000 first prize for his 14-under-par score of 202, one stroke better than Larry Nelson. On Feb. 21, Pate sank a 6-foot putt for a birdie on the final hole for a 1-stroke victory over Jay Haas in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Andy Williams Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course. Pate became only the second golfer to win the San Diego double -- the T of C and the Andy Williams. (Tom Watson did it in 1980.) Pate\u0027s putt gave him a final round of 68 and a 72-hole total of 19-under par 269. Pate also will be the last Andy Williams winner. After a 21-year affiliation, the Century Club of San Diego announced Nov. 22 that Williams has ended his involvement as host of the tournament. It will now be known as the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open. 2. The meet belongs to Olympians. A host of track and field stars showed up at the Michelob Invitational outdoor track meet in June. Double Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee took just three long jumps. Two were fouls, but her first -- 24 feet 3 inches -- was just 2 1/2 inches short of her American record. After competing, Joyner-Kersee attended the wedding of UCLA\u0027s Gail Devers, formerly of Sweetwater, and Ron Roberts, a former Bruin distance runner. Florence Griffith Joyner -- Flo Jo -- gave an indication of Olympic glory to come, winning the 100 meters in 10.89 seconds. Mary Decker Slaney had an easy time in the 2,000 meters, winning in 5 minutes 36.35 seconds. Ramona Pagel became the first American woman to surpass 20 meters in the shot put with a throw of 66-2 1/2. 3. And the rest of the story. -- Joan Hansen, a Solana Beach distance runner, decided not to try to compete in her second Olympics in 1988, opting instead to help start the San Diego National Athletes Fund, a nonprofit corporation designed to raise money for local athletes in training. In \u002784, Hansen ran in the 3,000-meter race with Mary Decker. Both fell, but few knew about Hansen because of the controversy surrounding Decker, who didn\u0027t finish. Hansen did, placing eighth. -- Major League Volleyball was a major league bust in May. Just 254 fans showed up for a match between the New York Liberties and the Chicago Breeze. The Breeze won. The MLV lost. The paltry attendance figures didn\u0027t entice San Diego investors to support a team here. -- In June, it was announced that San Diego State and USD would not play each other in men\u0027s basketball for the first time in 9 years. The rivalry was put on hold for a year because the two schools could not agree on a date. -- An estimated 3,000 athletes descended on San Diego to participate in 13 sports at 25 venues in the inaugural California State Games in mid July. -- In the men\u0027s open division championship of the 35th Over-the-Line tournament at Fiesta Island July 17, the Beachcomber team of Steve Miner, Billy Bright and John Torchia came out of the loser\u0027s bracket to defeat the Pennant Pups for the title. -- Christy Erb of Bonita and Kevin Kemp of Greensboro, N.C. won the girls\u0027 and boys\u0027 15-17 divisions of the Optimist Junior World Golf Championships at Torrey Pines July 22. -- With 8 seconds to play and the game tied, 14-14, Torrey Pines fullback Tim Walker kicked a 39-yard field goal to give the San Diego Section All-Stars a 17-14 victory over the Los Angeles City Section team at Mesa College July 30. -- Roger Gunn of Napa won the Buie San Diego County Open with a 6-under-par-66 on the North Course at Torrey Pines Aug. 5. -- Stephanie Rehe breezed by Ann Grossman, 6-1, 6-1, to win the Virginia Slims of San Diego singles title Aug. 7. -- Some top names were missing Aug. 12, but after a 4-year hiatus, the NBA returned to the San Diego Sports Arena for an all-star game that included former Aztec Michael Cage and Morse High alumnus Cliff Levingston (35 points, MVP). -- A local all-star team returned home in mid August after winning the International Boys\u0027 Baseball Friendship Tournament in Bejing, China. -- Mike Dodd, who attended SDSU, and Tim Hovland won $50,000 in the Cuervo Gold Crown volleyball series Sept. 17 at Mission Bay\u0027s Mariner\u0027s Point. -- Two drivers in the championship race of the Miller High Life Thunderboat Regatta at Mission Bay Sept. 18 escaped serious injury when the turbine/jet-powered hydroplanes boats they were racing flipped over and broke apart after being launched by a gust of wind. -- Wayne Gretzky had a goal and an assist for the Los Angeles Kings, who lost, 5-4, to the Winnipeg Jets in an exhibition before a sellout crowd of 13,155 at the Sports Arena Sept. 27. -- Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut was the first gymnast inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in Oceanside on Oct. 12. -- Rockers Bobby Blotzer of Ratt, \"Motor City Madman\" Ted Nugent and Tommy Lee of Motley Crue finished 1-2-3 in the Dodge International Star Challenge car race on Oct. 22 at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. The next day, Tom Hessert won the championship race of the Camel Grand Prix of Southern California. -- Former world record-holder and 2-time Olympian Tom Petranoff of Oceanside, along with several other track and field athletes, was suspended indefinitely by The Athletics Congress for participation in a series of meets in South Africa. TAC serves as the U.S. agent of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which does not sanction meets in South Africa because of that government\u0027s official policy of racial separation.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition CHINO ENDS POINT LOMA\u0027S HOME WINNING STREAK AT 143 GAMES There is nothing discrete about the state championship banners that hang in the high school gym at Point Loma High. The four gold-and-maroon flags represent, in part, the accomplishments of the Pointer girls\u0027 basketball teams, which until Saturday afternoon had won 143 consecutive games there. But Chino (12-0), the defending Southern Section 2-A champion from the Baseline League in Pomona Valley, wasn\u0027t intimidated by the banners, the streak or the gym and said so in a resounding 50-39 victory for the championship of the Ben Fisher tournament. \"They have those four banners hanging here,\" Chino Coach Joe Murillo said. \"We wanted to see what it would be like to come down here and play a ranked team.\" They found out. Using a zone defense to negate Point Loma\u0027s speed, Chino was able to curtail the scoring of Monica Filer and Tyeast Brown, who were held to 6 and 11 points, respectively. Sophomore Chris Drumm led the Pointers with 15, including a fourth-quarter 3-pointer. \"We just couldn\u0027t match up with them,\" Point Loma Coach Lee Trepanier said. \"Big people wear you down, and they did a good job of it.\" Point Loma\u0027s tallest player is Brown at 5-feet 11-inches. Chino has four players who are taller than 6 feet. \"We\u0027re tall,\" Murillo said. \"Sometimes the kids don\u0027t realize we can take advantage of that. In the third quarter, we started taking advantage of our size.\" The third quarter proved to be Point Loma\u0027s undoing. The Pointers had leads of 14-12 after a quarter and 22-21 at halftime, but Chino came out and outscored Point Loma, 14-6, in the third quarter. Point Loma was also hurt by its free-throw shooting. The Pointers were just 4 of 10 from the line. With the loss, Point Loma must start another winning streak from scratch. \"Records are made to be broken,\" Trepanier said. \"So now we start a new one. You don\u0027t get better if you don\u0027t play better teams, and we\u0027re still the best team in San Diego County.\" Felicia Franke and Francine Moreno led Chino with 22 and 10 points. In other tournament games: Poway 56, Oceanside 39 -- Dawn Gigstad and Julie Schwan each scored 12 as Poway took third place. Patrick Henry 49, Bonita Vista 36 -- Bonita Vista was able to stay within six points of Patrick Henry until the fourth quarter, when several turnovers cost the Barons in the fifth-place game. The Patriots outscored Bonita Vista, 19-10, in the final quarter. Rochelle Johnson (23) and Sorii Epps (14) combined for 37 of Patrick Henry\u0027s points. Johnson also was the leading rebounder with 17.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition COLLEGES; AZTECS TAKE LOW-KEY ROAD, BUT GET BY VERMONT Vermont certainly is not North Carolina. The first clue came midway through the first half of Saturday\u0027s Vermont-San Diego State basketball game, when a Catamount pass on a fast-break attempt catapulted out of bounds off a Catamount head. The second clue came early in the second half. SDSU was leading by five with 17:47 left when Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg called a timeout. Shawn Bell -- in the midst of his best game at San Diego State -- walked to the bench and looked at the scoreboard. Then he yawned. The Aztecs won, 83-76, but the atmosphere in the San Diego Sports Arena wasn\u0027t exactly as festive as Thursday\u0027s 103-92 loss to North Carolina. \"I would have rather been in a dental chair with no novocaine than endure that for 40 minutes,\" was the way Brandenburg explained it. A total of 1,529, the fewest to attend an Aztec home game since 836 watched SDSU play Hawaii in the final game of the 1986-1987 season, watched SDSU improve to 6-4. Against North Carolina, the Aztecs had set a home attendance record of 13,106. The fallout from the empty arena reached the court, where it was so quiet you could hear the ball drop. SDSU had 21 turnovers and Vermont 18. Both teams shot 48% from the field. \"And my New Year\u0027s resolution was to not take another drink all year long,\" Brandenburg said. \"But I think (the letdown) was very evident -- and predictable. We were tremendously emotionally high Thursday, and when you get that high, you valley out. We valleyed out really bad.\" One of the spectators at the North Carolina game was on the Vermont bench Saturday, and Tom Brennan, the Catamount coach, got exactly what he had hoped for. \"We caught them at the right time,\" said Brennan, whose team is 1-5 and has lost 10 consecutive road games. \"After playing in front of 13,000 rockin\u0027 and rollin\u0027 fans Thursday, and then to play in front of (something like) 13 . . . I kept saying \u0027stay ahead, stay ahead\u0027 (to the Aztecs) Thursday because I knew there had to be an emotional letdown.\" Bell, a transfer from Chicago State, finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds -- both personal bests at SDSU. Guard Tony Ross had a season-high 23 points, and his four second-half 3-pointers (he had five total) sparked the listless Aztecs enough to stop a handful of Vermont comebacks. The Aztecs built a 12-point halftime lead, 38-26, as Bell surpassed his 9.8-point scoring average with 15. Vermont whittled it down to five, 40-35, just 2 minutes into the second half and eventually cut it to three, 52-49, with 12:09 remaining. It was 55-51 with 10:38 left, but Ross made three 3-pointers in the next 3:24 to give SDSU some room to breathe. \"Shawn and Tony came through for us when everyone else was really struggling,\" Brandenburg said. Said Brennan: \"Ross and Bell were great tonight.\" SDSU guard Bryan Williams wasn\u0027t bad, either. He had 9 assists, giving him 19 for the last two games. \"We tried to get up for this game, but a lot of people were tired,\" Williams said. Said Aztec center Mitch McMullen: \"It was a win. You\u0027ve got to take every one you can get.\" McMullen, who had career highs of 29 points and 12 rebounds against North Carolina, managed just 10 points and 5 rebounds before fouling out with 2:41 to play. Joe Calavita led Vermont with 20 points.",

In his first game for Christian Heritage, junior forward Brad Soucie, a transfer from Eastern Michigan, scored 46 points and broke the single-game school record (33) set last year by his brother, senior forward Bill. Brad Soucie, who also holds the NCAA Division I playoff record for the most 3-point goals in a game (8) had six 3-pointers against the Crusaders. Mark Kraatz had 19 assists to break the school record he set last year. Christian Heritage (10-2) now has the best record in NAIA District 3 after its second victory this year over Point Loma Nazarene (2-8). Christian Heritage evened its all-time mark against PLNC at 2-2. Regulation ended at 102-102. Will Cunningham had 20 points and Kraatz added 17 for the winning Hawks.

Well, it was the year Pacific Symphony conductor Keith Clark was termed \"a dead fish,\" the year William Shakespeare was nearly a dead duck in Garden Grove and the year the rock zanies in Oingo Boingo held yet another \"Dead Man\u0027s Party\" at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. Jokes notwithstanding, there were encouraging signs of life locally. South Coast Repertory Theatre won major national recognition with the 1988 Tony Award as best regional theater in the country. The Grove Theatre Co. triumphed over considerable civic adversity that threatened for a time to shut down the county\u0027s only annual Shakespeare festival. The Pacific Symphony demonstrated new enthusiasm, with concerts led by guest conductors vying for the soon-to-be-vacated music director post. Local rock bands seemed to flourish, live and on record, despite a paucity of clubs in the county that would book them or radio stations that would air their music. The Improv in Irvine paved the way for a significant increase in the quantity and quality of stand-up comedy in the county. With that in mind, in the following four pages critics for The Times Orange County Edition offer compendiums of the best -- and in some cases, the worst and the silliest -- that the county had to offer during the year in art, music, dance, theater, pop and comedy. *\"Chris Burden: A 20-Year Survey,\" at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. Orange County\u0027s major art exhibition of 1988, a massive display of prickly and sometimes downright ornery works that are ultimately revelatory of a continually questioning, first-rate mind. *\"The Figurative Fifties,\" at Newport Harbor. Another major show, conceptually not as strong as it might have been but with important work on paper by Willem de Kooning and terrifically ebullient pieces by the likes of Larry Rivers, Grace Hartigan and George McNeil. *\"The Early Works of Charles E. Burchfield,\" at the Laguna Art Museum. The year\u0027s most enjoyable historical show, with passionate, idiosyncratic paintings by an American original. *Works from the Pauline Hirsh collection at Laguna Art Museum and the museum\u0027s South Coast Plaza annex. Provocative early pieces by several mostly lesser-known contemporary artists. *The Lorrin and Deane Wong collection at the Art Institute of Southern California. Pieces by important contemporary American and European artists, many of whom have never shown in Orange County. *\"Bare Facts, Sly Humor,\" at the Irvine Fine Arts Center and \"Suburban Visions, Middle-Class Dreams,\" at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton. Recent unconventional work in photography and a timely subject illustrated with some wonderfully quirky picks. Both of these shows were part of \"Photography: Inside Out,\" a countywide series of exhibits that helped boost the level of community art center offerings this year. * Angie Bray\u0027s \"Night Lies\" installation at BC Space in Laguna Beach: An installation tapping deep psychological veins via artlessly simple means, and also very possibly a breakthrough for the Laguna Beach artist. *\"Inside Out\" at BC Space. Shattering images and voices of the mentally ill imprisoned in a locked ward (by Mary Ellen Mark) or trying to make it on their own in the \"real\" world (by Lonnie Shavelson) -- surely the year\u0027s most significant show addressing a major social issue.

But the company was not lacking in its own roster of dancers. Among a trio of casts, Sabina Allemann was a most lyric, expressive Tatiana, and Frank Augustyn a cold, world-weary Onegin. The Canadians also brought Glen Tetley\u0027s \"Alice,\" with Kimberly Glasco as a melting Young Alice and Rex Harrington as a Byronic Lewis Carroll. As a curtain-raiser, the company danced no less than Balanchine\u0027s profound \"The Four Temperaments\" -- and danced it superbly. *Merche Esmeralda brought demonic power, shattering intensity to \"Medea\" during the Royal Spanish National Ballet run at the Center, Aug. 2 to 7. *American Ballet Theatre unveiled a costly new staging of \"Swan Lake\" by company artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov during its Nov. 29 to Dec. 11 run at the Center.

Beth Eagleson, SDG\u0026E\u0027s corporate attorney, said Friday that the suit against Jerry P. and Cathy A.

According to company spokesman Dave Smith, load information refers to the energy used by household appliances. The law allows utilities to try to recover the cost of stolen electricity, plus treble damages. In this case, Eagleson said, that amounts to $127,789.50. In addition, she said, SDG\u0026E is seeking $300,000 in punitive damages. Eagleson did not say how the Goularts\u0027 case was discovered.

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition 1988; THE YEAR IN REVIEW; 1988: A HUMBLING YEAR FOR THE MIGHTY In Orange County in 1988, the natural disasters were few. The human misfortunes were many. The ground didn\u0027t shake too much, and even the drought-parched canyons did not ignite. True, there was the winter storm early in the year that caused the newly rebuilt Huntington Beach Pier to collapse. But that was nothing compared to the collapse of careers and the tumbling of stature among many of the county\u0027s once-towering figures. It was the year that the mighty fell: * A rising star in the Republican Party plummeted when he forged a signature on a check in a last-ditch effort to bail out his campaign for Congress. * A millionaire video producer from Newport Beach was charged with making illegal campaign contributions to failed Democratic presidential hopeful Gary Hart and other candidates. * An Orange County supervisor, running for Congress, was caught red-faced when it was revealed that she did not graduate from college, as her biographies stated. * Even the always-powerful Orange County Republican Party took it on the chin when it posted uniformed security guards at polling places in Latino areas of Santa Ana to warn non-citizens not to vote, prompting an FBI investigation into allegations of voter intimidation. Indeed, 1988 was the election year that many people would like to forget. In January, the venerable Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), a six-term congressman, surprised supporters by announcing that he would not run for reelection, which opened the door to a free-for-all that led to a promising young politician\u0027s demise. C. David Baker, Irvine city councilman and former college basketball star, seemed to be the heir-apparent to Badham\u0027s seat until C. Christopher Cox gave him a run for his money in the June primary. And when that money began to run short in the final days before the election, a desperate Baker turned to the bank account of a nonprofit health foundation that he directed for an advance on a loan that was a few days late. He wrote a $48,000 check to himself, signing his own name and forging the signature of a judge, a foundation director. He stopped payment on the check shortly after it was written, but the damage was done. Baker, who was narrowly defeated by Cox, pleaded guilty to a felony forgery count, but a Superior Court judge later reduced the charge to a misdemeanor. The judge ordered Baker to perform community service and gave him a year\u0027s probation and a 1-year suspended jail sentence. \"Regardless of what the penalty was today, this will not be over,\" Baker said on the day he was sentenced. Even when the sentence was imposed, Baker was delivering hot meals to the elderly and working with children. \"Some good will come out of this one way or another. I\u0027m not really sure how.\" Another legislative seat unexpectedly opened with the death of Assemblyman Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana) the day after voters nominated him for a second term. That opened up a king-sized contest between Republicans and Democrats for his seat, and that race, too, led to a finish-line stumble. Sent Out the Guards In their fervor to see their candidate, Curt Pringle, win, county Republican Party officials not only got out the vote on Nov. 8, they also sent out the guards. Uniformed security guards were hired by the party to stand watch at heavily Latino polling places to warn people that it was illegal for non-citizens to vote. The Democrats cried foul, and even high-ranking Republicans denounced the move. The FBI and district attorney\u0027s office are now investigating whether election laws were violated, and several Latino and labor organizations have filed suit to overturn the election results in the 72nd Assembly District, where Pringle ended up winning by a mere 867 votes. Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder\u0027s election foibles left her with a red face. Running for Congress in the June primary, Wieder conceded under pressure from her opponent that she had left uncorrected a 25-year-old error on her biography that stated she had received a bachelor\u0027s degree in journalism from Wayne State University in Detroit. In truth, she was unable to attend college because of family finances. Also under fire from slow-growth advocates for her votes on development agreements, Wieder lost the race. Karl Stubbed His Toe Republicans did not have a monopoly on election-year problems. Stuart Karl Jr., the millionaire producer of the Jane Fonda workout tapes, was fined $60,000 and placed on 3 years\u0027 probation for making $185,000 in illegal campaign contributions to self-destructing presidential candidate Gary Hart and others. \"To be honest, I\u0027m not sure why I did these things,\" Karl said after his sentencing. \"You\u0027re attracted to the lure of being involved. People begin to make you feel important. I should have looked deeper and not done the things I did. . . . \" Hamburger magnate Carl N. Karcher also took a tumble. Known for his fast food and patriotism, the founder of Carl\u0027s Jr. restaurants was accused by the federal government of insider trading, for allegedly tipping off his relatives about some bad news that his company was about to release. While a federal judge has ruled that Karcher\u0027s son, Carl Leo Karcher, did engage in the illegal behavior, the case against the senior Karcher is still pending. \"These charges are totally false,\" Karcher said after the civil lawsuit was filed in April. \"My wife and I did not sell any of our stock, nor did we tell anyone else to do so. . . . To suggest that any of us would intentionally violate the securities laws is highly offensive.\" Crystal Cathedral Cutback Even God\u0027s squad was taken down a notch or two in 1988. While televangelist Robert H. Schuller stayed clear of the scandals that rocked his collared colleagues, the fallout hit the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. In May, Schuller announced sharp cutbacks in his \"Hour of Power\" broadcast ministry, a result of reduced contributions because of televangelism scandal \"shock waves,\" the October, 1987, stock market crash and the decision by a New York City cable television station to eliminate paid religious programming. Still, not everyone had a bad 1988. Braving the Siberian cold, marathon swimmer Lynne Cox of Los Alamitos became the first person to navigate a significant distance across the Soviet Union\u0027s Lake Baikal, the world\u0027s deepest lake. America\u0027s darling and Placentia\u0027s own Janet Evans won three gold medals in the pool at the Summer Olympics in Seoul. And despite the misfortunes of other politicians, two former White House aides were launched on promising careers. Cox, after toughing it out with Baker in the congressional primary, sailed to easy victory in November. Dana Rohrabacher, after tipping off voters to Wieder\u0027s erroneous resume, was elected to the 42nd Congressional District post that was vacated by Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach), who tried -- and failed -- to become the state\u0027s treasurer. Political Comeback Still, there was perhaps no bigger political comeback in Orange County in 1988 than the one that took place on a gentle hillside in Yorba Linda. The honoree was not able to attend, but hundreds of supporters gathered to watch a bulldozer scrape up the first bucket of dirt where a library soon will stand to house the papers and mementos of Orange County\u0027s native son and the nation\u0027s only resigned president, Richard M. Nixon. Times Orange County Edition librarian Dan Crump assisted in the research of this article.",

Jon Cazallaro was arrested by Los Alamitos police after his girlfriend returned to her Los Alamitos home from work early Friday and found her son alone and bleeding.

Here are condensed versions of some of those letters. We appreciate their taking the time to share their viewpoints and look forward to hearing from you in 1989. Mission Viejo\u0027s elections were marked by an evil partisanship that destroys the fabric of a local community. There are many very good reasons that city councils, supervisors, school boards, judges, city attorneys and planning commissions should not be elected on a national political party basis. The chief rationale is that the issues they decide involve quasi-judicial functions and executive-legislative interpretations. Neither party serves the local constituency well by attempting to influence the voter to vote along party lines. The motivation is purely selfish and defeats the essence of local control. The issues are essentially nonpartisan. THOMAS M. WHALING El Toro",

After a year of reckless disregard for the law, I was cited recently for walking my dog off the leash. I have difficulty with the leash law, which dictates that all dogs, even those with no criminal record, have to be restrained when outdoors. No such law pertains to the roving gangs of tough cats. The officer allowed that he thought it was indeed a shame that dogs in Newport Beach had no place to run free. I don\u0027t walk Sophie without a leash anymore. I\u0027d like to say that I\u0027ve been rehabilitated.

Sizemore on the homeless: For all our concern with morality we are confronted daily with an immense evil that few seem to care about and fewer still seek to halt. That evil is homelessness in Orange County, and its companions: poverty, illness and hunger. For most, accustomed to our county\u0027s image of prosperity, it is virtually impossible to believe that thousands of Orange County residents are living in conditions reminiscent of the Appalachia of 3 decades ago. For the few who become aware of this issue there is always the comfortable lie that the poor deserve their rags, malnutrition and loss of dignity. The truth is a horrifying indictment of Orange County\u0027s values and priorities -- both public and private. It takes only $4 a day to shelter, feed and assist the homeless. The issue is seldom a lack of resources -- it is usually lack of concern, leadership or, in a very real sense, a lack of morality when it comes to the poor.",

It was a mother\u0027s affair, and the doctor\u0027s business. The husband\u0027s principal task was to stay out of the way -- just get mom to the hospital in time. This time I was there. In the delivery room, actually being helpful. The years and the participation in the delivery have given me new perspective on new little human beings. I look upon them for what they are, not what they will be. They are struggling, curious, funny and courageous. Little things mean a lot to them. Children are children. They are not, nor should they ever be expected to be, small adults. Twenty years ago, it couldn\u0027t have been this way.

That was the question Orange County voters faced Nov. 8.

As a registered Republican, even I am amazed at how bold our leaders have become. Our elective process is founded on the principle that the voter not be intimidated at the ballot box.

As we look back, some of those thoughts are recalled: Jeff Fister on high-priced housing: I recently made my first trip back to Southern California after moving from Orange County. I opened up the newspaper and read, among other things, that the average Orange County home price is $175,000, highest in the nation. It is no wonder that the middle-class dream of owning a home is now out of reach for most young Orange County families. I\u0027m a case in point. Before moving we lived in a two-bedroom apartment in Westminster for $610 a month. I accepted a job in Denver. We moved into a brand new three-bedroom, two-story home. It includes a yard, a full basement and a view of the mountains. We bought the house for $110,000 at a 7.8% fixed, 30-year mortgage rate. A staffing manager who recruits professional workers for my new company told me that the richest pool of engineers is in Southern California -- it\u0027s easy to lure them away because of the high cost of housing.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition 1988 THE YEAR IN REVIEW; EVANS WINS FAME, PASSES UP FORTUNE; TRIPLE GOLD MEDALIST FROM PLACENTIA RATES AS ORANGE COUNTY\u0027S TOP STORY We want Janet. We want Janet shampoo (She cleaned up at Seoul, now she wants to clean up your scalp), we want Janet toothpaste (She\u0027ll do to your plaque what she did to the East Germans) and we want Janet Cliff Notes (When gold medals get in the way of The Great Gatsby). We want Janet-Jammies, we want JANET-LAND and yes, we want our JTV. We want Janet Evans in our newspapers and magazines, on our coffee tables and television screens. We want Janet because she\u0027s the best, the brightest and because she giggles after she wins Olympic gold medals, sets swimming world records or eats pizza. We want Janet Evans so badly that when she returned home to Placentia after winning three gold medals (400-meter individual medley, 400- and 800-freestyle) during the Seoul Summer Olympics, we practically chased her back to South Korea. Television cameras, still photographers, newspaper reporters, magazine writers, TV personalities. And that was just Day 1. Taking in the crush of media-types onto Placentia\u0027s El Dorado High School, where Evans is a senior and reigning homecoming queen, classmate Shane Borowski said, \"We all feel sorry for her. I mean, look at that.\" Evans claimed she wanted to be \"Just Janet,\" but her commercial value has been assessed in mega-bucks. Still, she\u0027s balked at signing professional endorsements, choosing to search for a semblance of a normal life. Good luck. At age 17, Janet Evans was Orange County\u0027s top sports story of 1988. The 105-pound girl from Placentia was bigger than the play-dead Angels and their amazing revolving managers (Mauch-to-Cookie-to-Moose-to-Rader). Bigger than the Rams, whose Super Bowl hopes got as far as a wild-card game in Minnesota. That\u0027s where they lost under climatic conditions usually reserved for better shops and department stores. She made a bigger splash than Lynne Cox, who swam a Russian lake in search of a different kind of medal. (What\u0027s so funny about peace, love and understanding?) She was a bigger hit than Angel catcher Bob Boone, who had his best year batting and then bolted the Angels for the Kansas City Royals for just one dollar more than he earned with the Angels in 1988. Evans headed an amazing army of Orange County athletes under 21 years of age who showed up their elders during the year. Placentia\u0027s Michael Chang, 16, became the youngest male to win a singles match at Wimbledon and went on to become, along with Andre Agassi, the next great hope for American tennis. Placentia\u0027s Michele Granger, 18, now a freshman at California, was recognized as the world\u0027s greatest softball pitcher, setting a dizzying array of national softball pitching records while at Valencia High. There was Servite High\u0027s Derek Brown, 17, who set the county single-season rushing record and University of Houston running back Chuck Weatherspoon, 20, a La Habra High alumnus who rushed for 1,005 yards and led the nation in yards per carry (8.5). There were Elaine Youngs (El Toro), Jenny Evans (Newport Harbor) and Laurie Jones (Huntington Beach) who, as freshmen, played major roles on the UCLA women\u0027s volleyball team that went 34-0 before losing in the semifinals of the NCAA championships. Bob Hamelin, at age 20, batted .514 for Rancho Santiago College and hit a state-record 31 home runs and 105 RBIs in 48 games. The Mater Dei boys\u0027 basketball team won its fourth consecutive 5-A championship despite recruiting allegations made against its athletic programs and the team\u0027s failure to win the league title. Corona del Mar High, with an enrollment of only 1,400, won Southern Section championships in girls\u0027 track, girls\u0027 tennis, water polo, football and a state championship in boys\u0027 cross-country. The Irvine High girls\u0027 volleyball team won its second straight state championship. The grownups\u0027 table -- filled with resignations, firings, disappointment and guys named Moose -- did have some bright spots. Greg Louganis of the Mission Viejo Nadadores became the first male to sweep gold medals in diving in two Olympics. Newport Harbor\u0027s Greg Barton won two gold medals in kayaking during the Summer Olympics, becoming the first American to win a gold medal in singles kayaking. The Rams\u0027 Jim Everett set team single-season records for pass completions, yards and touchdowns. Receiver Henry Ellard set a season record for receptions. The Angels\u0027 Johnny Ray was an All-Star. But overall, it was the kids who were more than all right in 1988. And leading the way were . . . NOT JUST JANET ANYMORE Dr. John Troup, director of U.S. Swimming Inc., had tested more than 1,000 swimmers for energy efficiency when he came across Janet Evans. After testing her prior to the Summer Games, he proclaimed Evans the most energy efficient \"male or female\" swimmer today. \"I\u0027ll stop short of saying Janet\u0027s a fish,\" said Troup, in a Sports Illustrated article, \"but physiologically she\u0027s very similar.\" Whatever she was, she was like nothing most people had ever seen -- three gold medals and one world record in events long dominated by women with thick shoulders. She tore through the Olympic pool with a slapping stroke that, above water, looked like the last desperate plea of a drowning victim. Experts told us what happens above the water doesn\u0027t matter, it\u0027s what happens below, and below the water, they said, Janet Evans was perfect. Three gold medals made that easy to figure. But what seemed to endear Evans to the American public was what happened above the water: the block-long smile, the giggles, the absolute absence of pretense. She became insta-star, America\u0027s kid sister. Swimmer Matt Biondi won more gold medals (5), sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner was more awesome to watch, Carl Lewis and Greg Louganis might have proven themselves the nation\u0027s greatest Olympians, but no American came back from Seoul more adored than Janet Evans. She walked off a plane and in front of a television camera. Make that cameras. Returning to Placentia, the Evans\u0027 family car passed under banners thanking Janet, lawns drafting her (\"Janet For Mayor,\" the placards read) and home to a block party attended by 500 close friends, well-wishers, strangers, gawkers and minicams. Her first day back at school was no less hectic: battalions of reporters and photographers descending upon El Dorado High. She appeared with rich man, Johnny Carson of The Tonight Show, and Poorman, on KROQ radio with deejay The Poorman, and received an invitation to the White House from The Man. She rode in the Disneyland Parade, the Macy\u0027s Thanksgiving Parade and was grand marshal of the Placentia Heritage Days Parade. Naively, she observed, \"I\u0027ve never come from a meet and had anything like this happen.\" Looking back with several months of perspective, she revised, \"I guess I should have realized that it was the Olympics.\" She said that sitting in a hotel room in Phoenix, the day before she was to be grand marshal of the Fiesta Day Parade. She has been the toast at banquets, luncheons and award presentations. But she has refused to sign any endorsement deals. Though the media demand for her is much less frenzied, \"it\u0027s died down a lot,\" it is still constant -- there are a couple national magazine covers planned for her for early 1989. There are more than a few companies that would love to have her on their side of the debit column. But no. One call to Biondi, who did sign the endorsement deals, persuaded her. \"He told me he didn\u0027t have a home, that he just lived from hotel room to hotel room, \u0027just going where they tell me to,\u0027 \" Evans said. \"We talked to them (companies) and they said I could make a lot of money but it would be a full-time job, that I would be so busy that I wouldn\u0027t be able to finish high school. \"I know if I did it, I could be set for life, but finishing high school is very important to me, so I said no.\" And then she probably smiled. THREE IN A FISHBOWL Michael Chang stepped into 1988 already having the distinction of being the youngest male tennis player to win the U.S. Tennis Assn. national 18-and-under singles title and the youngest to win a singles match at the U.S. Open. In 1988, at 16, he became the youngest to win a singles match at Wimbledon. He advanced to the U.S. Open\u0027s fourth round this year before being eliminated by the 18-year-old Agassi. With the best tennis players in the world now residing in West Germany and Sweden, Chang and Agassi\u0027s coming of age signaled hope for American men\u0027s tennis, which has been mired in post-Jimbo/Big Mac depression. Like Agassi, Chang hits the ball with amazing velocity and moves his body just about as fast. Pancho Segura compared him to a young Ken Rosewall. France\u0027s Henry LeConte succinctly summed up Chang\u0027s past, present and future when he said, \"He moves so quickly with such good timing. I\u0027m thinking, \u0027Sixteen years old?\u0027 God.\" Michele Granger did everything in 1988 to confirm that she is the best softball pitcher in the world. She ended her high school career at Valencia holding national records for single-season strikeouts, career strikeouts, career no-hitters and tied the mark for single-season no-hitters. But while she has won numerous national and international titles -- including a gold medal during the 1987 Pan American Games -- she failed to win a Southern Section championship in her 4 years at Valencia High. Her high school career came to a bizarre end during a 25-inning, 3-A semifinal game against La Mirada that took 2 days to play. Valencia had 10 hits in the game but failed to score. The Tigers also made 9 errors, 3 of which led to La Mirada\u0027s 1 run and the victory. Granger struck out 40 in the game and afterward, in, perhaps, 1988\u0027s greatest overstatement said, \"I let my team down.\" Derek Brown came into 1988 having performed well in 2 varsity seasons as the starting tailback for arguably Orange County\u0027s highest-profile football program -- Servite High in Anaheim. But he played in the long shadow cast by Crespi High\u0027s Russell White, who came into this year a two-time winner of the large-school division\u0027s most valuable player award. White began the season with the publicity, but Brown eventually made the season his own. In a memorable October meeting between the two backs, Brown outgained White 312 yards to 81 as Servite won the game 35-20. Brown went on to lead the Southern Section in rushing and set an Orange County single-season rushing record with 2,301 yards. He and Fountain Valley quarterback David Henigan were named co-Division 1 most valuable players. When it was clear that Brown was having a better season than White, the Crespi back quipped, \"He better remember who was the originator and who is the imitator.\" By year\u0027s end, Derek Brown and the rest of Orange County\u0027s kid wonders made certain they\u0027d be remembered for quite a while.",

    "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition STOCK WATCH: SOME COMPANIES HIT HARDEST BY CRASH PICKED UP THE PIECES, CAME OUT AHEAD On Friday, the last trading day of 1988, the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly climbed above the level it had enjoyed before the October, 1987, market collapse. It was a fitting end to a year that proved stronger than expected, with the Dow increasing 12%. It was equally fitting that the best performing Orange County stocks of 1988 were among those hardest hit by the crash. Orange County\u0027s star performers managed to rescue themselves from the rubble to either approach or surpass their pre-crash highs. In most cases, analysts said, they are solid companies that enjoyed healthy returns. ICN Biomedicals, a Costa Mesa medical instruments and chemicals company, led the pack on a percentage basis. The stock rose 331%, starting the year at $3.25 and finishing at $14. For the first 9 months of its current fiscal year, ICN Biomedicals has enjoyed a 35% increase in earnings. Its third-quarter performance was even stronger, with profits up 59%. Gradco Corp., an Irvine manufacturer of office copier and printer products, placed second, appreciating 126% for the year. Gradco stock, which began the year at $5.875, closed at $13.25. In the fiscal year ended March, 1988, Gradco reported net income of $4.1 million on sales of $90.9 million, and the company continued to post strong numbers over the latter part of the year. During the past 12 months, most investors steered clear of small companies. Many had been burned badly by the crash. \"A lot of the smaller Orange County companies are not very liquid, and they just got hammered in the crash, as people fell over themselves to get out of them,\" said Larry Selwitz, director of research at Cruttenden \u0026 Co., a Newport Beach brokerage. Many investors who got back into the market in 1988 initially chose to buy stocks in larger, more established companies. But as the year wore on and many Orange County companies began to report strong earnings, investors started funneling money into such companies as ICN Biomedicals, Ropak and Gradco. \"The stock of some of these companies had become so oversold that people realized these prices offered unusually good value,\" Selwitz said. \"It was an opportunity for people to make a lot of money.\" Meanwhile, the county\u0027s biggest market losers generally reflected unspectacular corporate performance. Resdel Industries, a Newport Beach electronics firm, lost the most ground in 1988. Its stock began the year at $5.25 a share and crashed to $1.4375, a 73% decline. The company posted an $8.3-million loss for the year ended June 30 and disclosed in October that it had laid off 130 people, or more than a third of its work force. The firm\u0027s problems were attributed primarily to unsuccessful efforts to expand through acquisitions. Another bomb was Diceon Electronics, which began the year trading at $30.50 but declined to $12.50 at year end, losing 59% of its value. Diceon had sales of $147 million and earned $9.8 million in the fiscal year ended in September. But most of its profits were realized in the first 6 months of the year, while the second half was a dud. Analysts are projecting that the company will have flat earnings for the first half of 1989. As a result, Diceon, which for several years has been one of Orange County\u0027s top performing growth companies, was snubbed by analysts and investors. Preston Athey, a growth fund manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, said he continues to hold Diceon and several other Orange County stocks because of what he believes are bright prospects for small growth companies in 1989. T. Rowe Price has about $1.3 billion invested in emerging growth funds. The investment firm\u0027s Orange County holdings include National Education of Irvine, Silicon Systems of Tustin and Archive Corp. Athey said a statistical indicator used by T. Rowe Price recently signaled that many, small growth companies \"are grossly undervalued\" relative to historic norms. \"If the past is any indication, 1989 is the year that these stocks will do very well relative to the rest of the market,\" Athey said. He said he is particularly bullish about small growth companies because many economists and analysts are projecting that their earnings growth will outpace larger companies in 1989.
