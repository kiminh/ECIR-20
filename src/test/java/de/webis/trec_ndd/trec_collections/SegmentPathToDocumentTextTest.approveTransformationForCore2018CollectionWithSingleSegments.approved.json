    "content": "GWU students help small groups raise money\nCapital Business\nDylan Fox, right, is founder and chief executive of Crowdvance, a new online fundraising platform. He is pictured here with Zack Herman and Maz Obuz. (Evy Mages/FOR THE WASHINGTON POST)\nWhile most students at George Washington University are studying for finals, Dylan Fox is tracking revenue and client activity on his laptop in his downtown office. Fox’s grades may be “going like this,” he says, his hand motioning like a diving plane, but the graduating senior and economics major has received nods of approval from business executives.\nThe student entrepreneur started Crowdvance, an online charitable donation platform that has run fundraising campaigns for some 200 community groups since its creation last September.\nCrowdvance recently won first place in a business plan competition for college students from around the world, held at Texas Christian University. He took home the $15,000 prize for the company’s focus on values and social impact.\nNow Crowdvance is competing in the hot market of online giving. Sites such as DonorsChoose, GlobalGiving, Razoo, Causes, Network for Good and JustGive have spurred the rise in online charitable giving. Some worry the growing space could produce donor fatigue, but Fox and his business partner, Zachary Herman, a sophomore, said they believe Crowdvance can avoid that fate by using incentives to attract givers.\nCrowdvance is something like a cross between LivingSocial and online fundraiser Razoo, only it targets its support to very small community groups, such as a Little League team struggling to pay for its uniforms or a high school debate team that needs money to enter a national competition.\nWhen making a donation on Crowdvance, donors get a menu of exclusive deals — $25 off a concert ticket or 7 percent off a textbook rental for example. Then Crowdvance collects a service fee of 6.5 percent from the organization’s fundraising total. So far, incentive partners include Razorgator, ShoeBuy.com, Delivery.com and Ice.com.\nFox declined to disclose revenue.\n“Small organizations can’t generate a lot of direct donations because their networks aren’t big enough and their messaging isn’t strong enough,” said Fox, 21. “Selling cupcakes and T-shirts cost way too much money up front, they are risky and the revenue isn’t reflective of the time you put in and it burns out donors.”\nCrowdvance’s biggest success stories to date tend to involve groups associated with his college, such as the GWU triathlon club, which raised $600 to compete in a tournament. But participants also include groups such as the basketball league DC Metroball Youth Outreach, the Metro Warriors Youth Organization and the Autism Speaks chapter at University of Michigan. Participating organizations do not have to be registered nonprofits.\nFox has been an entrepreneur since middle school, charging friends for server space to play video games. During his sophomore year of college, he started an online toiletry subscription company, LeaveItToMom.com, that would deliver items to students each month.\nThen one afternoon last year, Fox — who developed a hobby designing Web sites — was fiddling with his design software when he thought of the idea for Crowdvance. He sent an e-mail to his fraternity brothers, and that’s when Herman expressed interest and became the marketing officer.\nFox, who spent free time in between classes at an incubator office space downtown, plans to work full time after he graduates in two weeks. He plans to bring on four interns this summer to help with acquisition, development and social media and do a second round of raising seed money.\nIn between their busy schedules, Fox and Herman meet with other students to encourage them to start social ventures.\n“I don’t want to be a big-time executive, I want to change the world,” Fox said. “I think you can only be successful if you’re not only creating a profit but a value.”\n",

    "content": "Danny Coale, Jarrett Boykin are a perfect 1-2 punch for Virginia Tech\nColleges\nVirginia Tech wide receiver Danny Coale (19) was lightly recruited out of Episcopal in Alexandria but has teamed with Jarrett Boykin for a record-breaking receiving duo. (John Bazemore/AP)\nNEW ORLEANS — Whenever a Virginia Tech offensive coach is asked how the most prolific receiving duo in school history came to be, inevitably the first road game in 2008 against North Carolina comes up.\nMidway through the first quarter, Virginia Tech had to call two timeouts in a row because then-freshmen Jarrett Boykin and Danny Coale couldn’t seem to line up right, and “they had those big eyes out there looking around,” Kevin Sherman, their position coach, said recently.\nNow that Boykin and Coale have only Tuesday’s Sugar Bowl remaining before leaving Virginia Tech with every major school record for a wide receiver, they’ve taken a different stance.\n“I still don’t think that was on us. Macho [Harris] was in the game and he lined up wrong,” said Boykin, as Coale sat next to him nodding in agreement.\nJust add that to the list of slights these seniors have had to overcome.\nBoykin has been the team’s leading receiver the past three seasons, using hands that need size XXXL gloves and a knack for out-maneuvering opposing cornerbacks in the air to set a single-season school record for receptions this year (57). He will end his career with more catches (180) and yards (2,854) than any other Hokies receiver.\nCoale, an Episcopal High graduate, leads Virginia Tech with 785 receiving yards this year. He is right behind Boykin in the school record books and became the team’s starting punter by the end of this season. Coach Frank Beamer has frequently marveled how “Danny just always seems to be open.”\nAnd yet neither warranted even honorable mention all-ACC status this year, a snub that quarterback Logan Thomas said made him “extremely upset” and left Beamer wondering about the media members who participated in the voting.\nIn retrospect, Boykin said he recognizes the lack of notoriety is partly due to Virginia Tech’s offensive philosophy. The Hokies have always been known for their rushing attack, and this year was no different. Running back David Wilson earned ACC player of the year honors during a year when Thomas set multiple records for a first-year quarterback.\n“There’s just some things that we were held back from being able to show,” Boykin said, “that we’re just as good as [South Carolina wide receiver] Alshon Jeffrey and [Oklahoma State wide receiver] Justin Blackmon. I feel like they’re great athletes, but at the same time we’re right up there with them.\n“It’s great playing wide receiver here because once we throw the ball, you have opportunities to get big chunks of yardage. What we can’t do is we’re not going to catch 100 balls for 1,500 yards and 22 touchdowns.”\nThe other issue is that neither has the sort of attention-grabbing personality or pedigree associated with big-time wide receivers these days.\nCoale has graduated with a degree in finance and was named the ACC’s top scholar-athlete this year. He speaks in measured tones reminiscent of a CEO and has yet to join Facebook or Twitter. Boykin is so quiet around the team facility that Beamer said he sometimes doesn’t notice him until he’s making catches on the practice field or in games.\nComing out of high school, Coale was barely recruited. Before showing up to a camp in Blacksburg one summer, his only scholarship offer was from VMI, where his father is the head of strength and conditioning. Coale still jokes that when he spent his redshirt year (2007) on the scout team, former Virginia Tech wide receivers and future NFL wideouts Eddie Royal, Andre Davis and Josh Morgan “must have thought I was a walk-on. I prefer to just fly under the radar.”\nBut their accomplishments haven’t gone unnoticed now that the clock is ticking on their careers. Quarterbacks coach Mike O’Cain said Thomas’s comfort level during his record-setting first year under center is a direct reflection of Boykin and Coale. “Not only are they gonna run the right route with the right timing, you know they’re gonna catch the ball,” he said.\nYears of lining up together has also created a special bond between the two, and it played out before the ACC championship game this year.\nBoykin was supposed to deliver the pregame speech, but always reticent about public speaking, he was afraid he might stutter and not be taken seriously. He asked Coale to take his place.\n“I’ve been through his struggles, he’s been through mine,” Coale said. “He’s a guy that I know I can count on, whether it’s five years from now, I just know I can count on him and he’ll be there. I know when I look back, part of my Tech experience is going to be him.”\n",

You can’t miss this ultrabright beacon — about negative fourth magnitude — skimming over the treetops. By mid-January, Venus hangs 30 degrees above the horizon at sunset, and the planet sets about 8:10 p.m.\nOn Jan. 24, a waxing young moon begins to ascend toward Venus in the western heavens. The lunar crescent sneaks closer to alluring Venus on Jan. 25, and by the evening of Jan. 26, the moon has passed by our neighbor planet.\nLike a 1950s teenager at a diner, Jupiter loiters in the east-southeast sky at dusk, in the Aries constellation. It’s a negative second magnitude (very bright) object. The waxing gibbous moon approaches this large planet Sunday and snuggles closer Monday evening. By Tuesday, the moon has passed Jupiter, but have no fear, we get an “instant replay” from Jan. 28-31.\nBright enough to see from the light-polluted Washington area, Mars and Saturn, both zero magnitude objects, become the New Year’s late-night revelers. The reddish Mars rises just before midnight now in the east. A few hours later, at 1:30 a.m., the ringed Saturn ascends the east-southeast. By late January, both planets loiter in the Virgo constellation, as Mars will rise about 9 p.m. and Saturn appears just before midnight.\nFind fleet Mercury now before sunrise in the southeast, in the constellation Ophiuchus, hugging the horizon.\nWith hot coffee, toast the Baby 2012 by viewing the Quadrantids meteor shower peak early Wednesday morning. The big, fat moon sets at 3:15 a.m., so very early risers could catch some falling stars between then and sunrise. The International Meteor Organization (www.imo.net) says the hourly rate could be 120, but, in all honesty, you’ll be lucky to spot a handful. If you spy them, they appear to emanate from the near the Big Dipper and Little Dipper constellations in the northeast. You might see a few errant Quadrantids up to Jan. 12, according to the IMO.\nDown-to-Earth events:\nJan. 5 — “How Do Astronomers Know How Big Asteroids Are?” a lecture by astronomer Melissa Hayes-Gehrke, at the open house, University of Maryland Observatory, College Park.
