    "content": "RYAN IS NOT ALONE AMONG BATTERED LEAD: The Jets remain a battered team, a fact of football life obscured by their wild-card playoff victory over the Chiefs. The Jets remain a battered team, a fact of football life obscured by their wild-card playoff victory over the Chiefs. Even though Pat Ryan threw yesterday in his first full-scale drill for Saturday\u0027s divisional playoff against the Browns in Cleveland, he is nursing a bruised arm. And several of his key teammates are also playing with injuries. \u0027\u0027My arm\u0027s always stiff,\u0027\u0027 Ryan said stoically. \u0027\u0027I get used to it.\u0027\u0027 Ryan has had a chronic arm problem since 1984, when he started the first 11 games despite the injury. He began taking a day off once a week, a practice he has continued since. \u0027\u0027I was in a lot worse shape in \u002784 than I am now,\u0027\u0027 he said. Still, the Jets are \u0027\u0027not playing with a full deck,\u0027\u0027 in the words of Coach Joe Walton. The injured regulars include Marty Lyons, the defensive lineman who was sidelined late in the season with a shoulder injury. Now, both shoulders are bothering him. \u0027\u0027Marty\u0027s been able to help us to a certain point in the game,\u0027\u0027 Walton concedes. \u0027\u0027I try not to take anything for the pain,\u0027\u0027 says Lyons. \u0027\u0027You go on emotion and adrenaline, and when it gets to the point it\u0027s unbearable, you take yourself out.\u0027\u0027 He was forced to take himself out against the Chiefs last Sunday. Mark Gastineau has played just one game since returning from knee surgery; Ken O\u0027Brien has a sprained right pinky that could limit him if he had to replace Ryan; the right tackle, Gordon King, and the left guard, Guy Bingham, are playing because the regulars are injured; Johnny Hector has not been on the field for three games because of a hamstring problem, leaving all the halfback duties to Freeman McNeil; Tom Baldwin is still at nose tackle for the sidelined Joe Klecko; Lance Mehl\u0027s surgery rushed Rusty Guilbeau\u0027s return to linebacker even though his knee rehabilitation wasn\u0027t complete. \u0027\u0027But,\u0027\u0027 asks Lyons, \u0027\u0027tell me who\u0027s a healthy team now?\u0027\u0027 Results against common opponents don\u0027t mean much because football often is a game of matchups. But, anyway, here are the Jets\u0027 and Browns\u0027 scores against common foes: Buffalo - The Jets beat the Bills twice, 28-24 and 14-13; Cleveland beat them, 21-17. Cincinnati - The Jets lost, 52-21; Cleveland split, losing, 30-13, and winning, 34-3. Pittsburgh - The Jets lost by 45-24; Cleveland swept the Steelers, 27-24 and 37-31. Kansas City - The Jets beat them in the wild-card game, 35-15; Cleveland beat them, 20-7. Indianapolis - A Jet sweep, 26-7 and 31-16; Cleveland won by 24-9. Miami - A Jet split, a 51-45 victory in overtime and a 45-3 thrashing; Cleveland beat them, 26-16. The record shows the Browns were 7-1 against these teams while the Jets had a 6-3 mark against them. The Jets have played in a Super Bowl and they have been to the American Conference championship game. But when they play the Browns they will be performing in their 18th game of the season - the most they have ever played. That A.F.C. championship season? That was 1982 - the strike season when they played only nine regular-season games. The Super Bowl season was only 14 regular-season games long. They had only one playoff game - a victory over the Raiders - before the Super Bowl. The Jets\u0027 37-10 victory over the Browns last season broke a six-year stretch between the teams in which no game was decided by more than 4 points. Two went into overtime (won by the Browns on field goals), another two were captured in regulation time by Cleveland on field goals and the Jets took one game by a missed extra point. The kicking may be a factor Saturday. Five Cleveland Stadium games this season have been decided by field goals, with the Browns winning four. \u0027\u0027It\u0027s a hard stadium to kick in,\u0027\u0027 says Pat Leahy of the Jets. \u0027\u0027It\u0027s open and cold, but I\u0027ve had some decent games in there.\u0027\u0027 Matt Bahr, the Browns\u0027 kicker, was injured on a tackle after a kickoff. Mark Moseley, cut by the Redskins, replaced him and has been fair, kicking 12 of 19. Leahy, though, is 16 for 19. JETS NOTEBOOK",

The main move was the removal of Rona Ambrose, left, as environment minister after months of condemnation. Clean air and climate change are likely to be major issues in the next national election, with the opposition Liberal Party now led by a former environment minister, Stéphane Dion. Ms. Ambrose was replaced by John Baird, who had been head of the Treasury Board. She is now intergovernmental affairs minister. CHRISTOPHER MASON",
