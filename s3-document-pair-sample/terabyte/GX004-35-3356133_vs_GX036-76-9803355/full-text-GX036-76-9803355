In 2001, Unit 1 had a capacity factor of 88.5 percent and supplied 7.75 billion kilowatthours of electricity.� Unit 2 produced 8.08 billion kilowatthours, with a capacity factor of 87 percent. The plant is operated by the Indiana Michigan Power Company and owned by American Electric Power. Sources: Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, "Annual Electric Generator Report." Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
