Summer (Summer) South Carolina Unit 1 Nuclear system supplied by Westinghouse Electric Corporation Capacity Net MW(e) Generation in 2002 Megawatthours Capacity Factor in 2002 Type Oper. License Issue Date Online Date License Expiration Date �R 986 �7,379,503 �85.4 % �PWR �Nov. 12, 1982 Jan. 1, 1984 �August 6, 2022 R = Revised Note:� The revised total shows that the Summer reactor was up rated in capacity from the previously reported 966 net MW(e). Description:� The Virgil C. Summer nuclear station occupies a site near Jenkinsville in Fairfield County, South Carolina.� The site includes the decommissioned experimental CVTR unit.� Monticello reservoir provides cooling water and feeds a pumped storage unit.�� In 2001, the Summer unit operated at 79.9 percent of capacity, producing 6.76 billion kilowatthours of electricity.� About two-thirds (66.7 percent) of the Summer plant is owned by its operator, the South Carolina Electric & Gas Company.� The remaining 33.3 percent is owned by the South Carolina Public Service Authority. Sources: Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, "Annual Electric Generator Report." Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
