debt bondage and serfdom and forced or compulsory labor; including forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict; The use, procurement or offering of a child for prostitution, production of pornography or pornographic performances; The use, procurement or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs as defined in the relevant international treaties; Work which by its nature or by the circumstances by which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety, and morals of children.   In determining the types of work likely to harm the health, safety and morals of children, Convention 182 considers the following: work which exposes a child to physical, psychological or sexual abuse; work underground, underwater, at dangerous heights or in confined workplaces; work with dangerous machinery, equipment and tools or handling or transporting heavy loads; work in an unhealthy environment including exposure to hazardous substances, agents or processes, or to temperatures, noise levels or vibrations damaging to the health; work for long hours or night work where the child is unreasonably confined to the premises.   The Timebound Program is designed to be a country-owned initiative.� Participation implies commitment by a country to mobilize and allocate national human and financial resources to combat child labor.� USDOL-supported programs assist governments in this process by identifying and supporting projects, measures, interventions, institutional mechanisms, and partnerships required to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.   Between FY 2001 and FY 2003, in addition to US $135 million earmarked for ILO/IPEC efforts, US $111 million was appropriated to USDOL for a Child Labor Education Initiative to fund programs aimed at increasing access to quality, basic education in areas with a high incidence of abusive and exploitative child labor.� The grant(s) awarded under this solicitation will be funded through this initiative. � USDOL's Child Labor Education Initiative seeks to nurture the development, health, safety and enhanced future employability of children around the world by increasing access to basic education for children removed from work or at risk of entering into labor.� Child labor elimination depends in part on improving access to, quality of, and relevance of education.   The Child Labor Education Initiative has four goals: Raise awareness of the importance of education for all children and mobilize a wide array of actors to improve and expand education infrastructures; Strengthen formal and transitional education systems that encourage working children and those at risk of working to attend school; Strengthen national institutions and policies on education and child labor; and Ensure the long-term sustainability of these efforts.   B.� BARRIERS TO EDUCATION FOR WORKING CHILDREN AND COUNTRY BACKGROUND   1. Child Labor and Barriers of Access to Education   Throughout the world there are complex causes to child labor as well as barriers to education for children engaged in or at risk of working.� These include:   Poverty � whereby families need children's income for survival, there is a high opportunity cost to enrolling a child in school, and the direct and indirect costs of schooling are unaffordable.   Education system barriers � which include low quality and relevance of education and curricula; low teacher training/preparation of school personnel to address education of children with special needs, such as child laborers; poor teaching methods; lack of or weak systems to address reintegration of dropouts, or to provide equivalency and/or bridge programs between non-formal and formal or vocational education.   Infrastructure barriers � which include distance to school; inadequate school buildings (too small, too few primary, secondary or vocational schools); overcrowded schools; lack of open spaces for physical activity and related facilities; lack of transportation; lack of latrines, water, electricity and other basic infrastructure.   Legal and policy barriers � which include policies that discourage school enrollment and retention, weak law enforcement, or non-existent, inconsistent or inadequate education policies for working children.   Resource gaps � which include either overall low level of resources within the country, or a low allocation of existing resources relative to the needs of working children, or to child labor eradication or education goals set by government policies.   Institutional barriers � which include weaknesses that hamper an organization's ability to effectively implement programs, and/or limited coordination among social partners (various level of government, NGOs, private sector) to match existing resources to education gaps and needs of working children.�   Informational gaps � which include lack of information on the education needs of child laborers or their educational performance so as to develop relevant and targeted programs; lack of available relevant social indicator data to identify, target and map families with working children; lack of consistent monitoring and evaluation of programs to draw lessons learned, or limited awareness on the part of different actors of the benefits of education for working children.   Demographic characteristics of children and/or families � which include factors that put a child at higher risk of child labor and lack of access to education, such as belonging to an ethnic group, gender or social class, family composition (e.g., single head of household or polygamous household, multiple siblings, etc.), being overage relative to grade.   Cultural and traditional practices � which include community attitudes that children should work and help the family, and attitudes and practices towards gender and social roles.   Weak labor markets and lack of employment for those more educated, which diminish the perceived value of an education, and increase the value of early entry into the labor market.   Although these elements and characteristics tend to exist throughout the world in areas of high child labor, they manifest themselves and/or combine in particular ways in each country of interest in this solicitation.� In their response to the solicitation, applicants should be able to identify the specific barriers to education and the education needs of specific children targeted in their project (e.g., children withdrawn from work, children at high risk of drop out into the labor force, children still working in a particular sector, etc.).� Short background information on education and child labor in each of the countries of interest is provided below.� For additional information on child labor in these countries, applicants are referred to The Department of Labor's 2001 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor available at http://www.dol.gov/ILAB/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/overview.htm or in hard copy from Lisa Harvey, U.S. Department of Labor, Procurement Services Center, telephone (202) 693-4570 (this is not a toll-free-number) or e-mail: harvey-lisa@dol.gov.   2. Country Background   The Dominican Republic   The Dominican Republic�s National Child Labor Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Trabajo Infantil), published in 2002, estimated that 18 percent of children between the ages of five and 17 years (428,720) are working.� The major sectors where children work are agriculture, services in the informal sector (shoe shiners, street vendors), domestic service, and prostitution.� In addition, reports indicate that Haitian children may be found working in the Dominican Republic on sugarcane plantations and in other hazardous occupations, and have documentation and likely language barriers to education.�� There are also reports that some Haitian children have been trafficked to the Dominican Republic, including for purposes of child labor.�   Between 1992 and 2002, the Dominican Secretariat of Education (SecretarRa de Estado de Educaci�n) engaged in a ten-year reform program (Plan Decenal) that included goals of increasing educational access, improving quality, implementing curriculum reform, improving the social and economic conditions of teachers, approving a new education law, decentralization, increased community participation, and increased financial resources.� The plan, funded by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, greatly increased educational access for more children, but improvements are still needed in the areas of educational quality, teacher training, teacher living conditions, implementation of the education law, parent/community participation, and budget.�� Basic education in the Dominican Republic is free and compulsory between the ages of five and 14.   In spite of large investments in the education system, many gaps and challenges remain that hamper efforts to prevent child labor through education, and provide access to education for child laborers.� These include a highly centralized education administration, lack of school access in rural areas, lack of vocational schools, and a less than adequate system for measuring and monitoring education results.�   Moreover, lack of official identity papers and documentation are serious barriers to school enrollment and affects thousands of children most vulnerable to child labor�rural children, and those of Haitian descent.� Several programs have been developed to address the problem of lack of documentation, but none has been broadly successful.�   Many Dominican teachers lack motivation to improve their teaching style or to comply with school schedules because of low salaries.� Teacher strikes for higher pay are frequent.� Time in-class and time spent on learning tasks are lower in the Dominican Republic than in most other Latin American countries.� Teachers in rural areas may also miss school because of transportation difficulties.� In most Dominican classrooms there is a lack of active, participatory, student-centered pedagogy.� Also, teachers are not prepared to deal with children with special needs such as those of working children, and children at risk of or engaged in commercial sexual exploitation.�   There are limited alternatives to the public schools since there are few NGOs specializing in education.� Also, Dominican NGOs operate under an obsolete law dating from 1920.�� Furthermore, the high levels of overage students relative to grade discourages many children from continuing altogether, and results in permanent desertion and premature entry into labor.�   The Government of the Dominican Republic has committed itself to the implementation of a Timebound Program to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.� The funding provided by this award will provide resources for the education component of the Timebound Program funded by USDOL and implemented through the ILO/IPEC.�   Morocco   According to a 1999 diagnostic by the Ministry of Employment and the ILO, there are approximately 9.8 million children in Morocco under the age of 15, and approximately 6.5 percent of children in this age group work.� About 90 percent of working children are in rural areas in the agriculture sector, often in animal husbandry and other agricultural tasks.� Children also work as weavers in the carpet industry; in small family-run workshops that produce ceramics, woodwork, and leather goods; and as mechanics, porters, tourist guides, street vendors, and beggars.� Children work as apprentices before they reach 12 years of age, particularly in the informal handicraft industry.� In urban areas, girls work as domestic servants, often in situations of unregulated "adoptive servitude," and teenagers are reported to engage in prostitution.� Street children engage in diverse forms of work including selling cigarettes, begging, shining shoes and other miscellaneous occupations.� It is estimated that 90 percent of working children are between the ages of 10 and 14, and 50 percent are victims of abuse and work more than 50 hours a week.   Morocco has identified education as a major component of the national and sectoral plans to combat child labor produced by the Ministry of Employment.� It has also outlined its strategy for education reform in a national Charter that focuses on increasing educational access, reducing educational disparities, and involving different social sectors in partnerships for education.� Education is free and compulsory between the ages of six and 15.� The government has targeted universal primary enrollment by 2005-2006, and universal secondary education by 2008-2009.   Despite the progress made in increasing access to basic education in Morocco, the Ministry of National Education estimates that approximately 2 million children between the ages of eight and 16 have either never attended school or dropped out before completing the first level.� The ILO/IPEC estimates that 80 percent of working children in Morocco are out of school.� Ensuring their access to education will need to be addressed if Morocco is to meet its national goal of enrolling all children aged 12-14 in secondary school by 2008-2009.� The Ministry of National Education's Non-Formal Program, working in partnership with an active NGO community, has reached only approximately 113,545 children aged eight to 15 since 1997.� Although 70 percent of children who enter the non-formal program complete it, only about 10 percent transition into the formal system.� The Government of Morocco has recently created a State Secretariat for Literacy and Non-Formal Education to address many of the issues facing out-of-school children.   The funding provided by this solicitation will contribute to addressing these important challenges.� Applicants are strongly encouraged to address their efforts to areas of the highest concentrations of child labor (i.e., agriculture), and sectors in rural and urban areas with the worst forms of child labor.   The Philippines   Child labor in the Philippines is set primarily in the context of poverty, with 31.8 percent of Filipino families living below the poverty line in 1997, compared to 33.7 percent in 2000.� The increase in the number of families living in poverty has contributed to the rise in the number of working children.� In 2001, the Philippine National Statistics Office estimated that 4 million children between the ages of five and 17 were working, or 16.2 percent of children in this age group.� This figure accounts for a 12 percent increase in the number of working children since 1995.   Children work predominantly in rural areas.� Almost half of all child workers are engaged in agricultural activities, while other children work in informal footwear production, drug trafficking, pyrotechnics production, deep-sea fishing, mining and quarrying, and pearl farming.� In the informal sector children are engaged in scavenging and begging.� Children are also engaged as domestic servants and are involved in the commercial sex industry.   Since 1991, the Education for All (EFA) strategy has been a cornerstone of the Philippine's plan of action to improve the public education system, but government plans to address the particular needs of working children are limited.� There are numerous gaps in the public education system and other socio-cultural or institutional barriers that may prevent children engaged in or at risk of working in the worst forms of child labor from receiving quality and relevant basic education.� While significant achievements have been made in combating child labor and promoting basic education, there is a need to link these efforts and address issues related to the provision of education for children working or at risk of working.�   The current National Development Plan for 2001-2004 includes universal primary education as a goal.� From 1991 to 1998, primary net enrollment rates in the Philippines increased from 85 percent to 96 percent.� The increase in enrollment rates reflects the government's commitment to providing universal primary education, but there are still challenges related to strengthening the quality and relevance of education, which is key to the retention of children in the school system.� Currently, an estimated 69 percent of children who enter primary school in the Philippines reach grade 5.   In addition, the impact of education reforms has not yet been fully extended to children vulnerable to child labor.� Even though formal education is free and compulsory for six years, families are often expected to shoulder other associated costs such as food, uniforms, school supplies, transportation, and, in some instances, fees for capital outlays or building maintenance (e.g., janitorial services, toilets, and electricity).� With many parents' earnings falling below the poverty line, the inability of public schools to subsidize these extra costs places considerable economic strain on families.� As a result, high costs to schooling limit access to education, negatively impact school attendance, and may contribute to the increase in the labor supply of children.   The Government of the Philippines is dedicated to the elimination of the worst forms of child labor within a specified period, and has committed to a Timebound Program to combat child labor.� USDOL expects the funding provided by this award to address some of the educational challenges within the Timebound Program framework, and the applicant will support education activities undertaken as part of USDOL's funding of the Philippines Timebound Program, which is being implemented through ILO/IPEC.� These education activities must complement and reinforce the existing Timebound strategy, but not duplicate efforts already funded by USDOL through ILO/IPEC.   Direct services of the already-funded ILO-IPEC education component of the Timebound Program will concentrate primarily on the provision of non-formal, transitional and vocational education to children withdrawn from work and those at-risk of working in the sectors targeted by the Timebound Program.� These activities correspond to gaps identified in the existing system.� For example, until very recently, the Department of Education's Bureau of Non-Formal Education only offered non-formal education programs to out-of-school youths aged 15 and above.� Although it is currently preparing to offer non-formal education to children ages six to 14, the Bureau lacks the funds to develop appropriate curricula and learning modules.� An additional challenge to providing transitional education is that children in non-formal programs frequently experience difficulty mainstreaming into formal education, such as passing an equivalency test required for re-entry in formal schooling.�   Uganda   An ILO-IPEC child labor report based on the 2000-2001 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey estimated the total number of working children aged five to 17 years in the country at 2.9 million, accounting for 34.2 percent of all children in this age group. �Furthermore, the report estimated that more than half of all working children in Uganda are aged 10-14 years.� The Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD) has drafted a national policy and plan of action to combat the worst forms of child labor, including children engaged in commercial agriculture, fishing, domestic labor, the informal sector, street activities, commercial sexual exploitation, construction sector, and children in armed conflicts.��   USDOL has targeted several of these sectors through programs implemented by ILO/IPEC.� USDOL has also financed surveys on child labor in Uganda.� Recognizing that forced and compulsory recruitment of children in armed conflict is a worst form of child labor as identified in ILO Convention 182, USDOL, through funding provided by this solicitation, seeks to support the education needs of this population in northern Uganda.   In addition to the MGLSD, the Ministry of Education has been engaged in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.� In 1997 this ministry instituted a policy of Universal Primary Education (UPE) to make formal schooling more affordable and thus more available to students in Uganda.�� Since the implementation of this policy, enrollment has increased dramatically, from 3.4 million in 1996 to 7.2 million in 2002.   Unfortunately, much of the success of this program has been concentrated in the south.� Sixteen years of war in northern Uganda has hindered the full implementation of UPE, and has created enormous barriers for young people living in these areas to gain access to and complete quality primary education.� Since the birth of the Lord�s Resistance Army�s (LRA) rebel campaign in 1986, between 10,000-15,000 Ugandan children have been abducted to serve as porters and soldiers for this rebel group. Abducted girls often suffer the added trauma of rape, and are frequently given to rebel commanders as sexual slaves.   In addition, at least half of the population living in areas of conflict in northern Uganda (a majority of whom are adolescents and children) is internally displaced. Escalated LRA attacks since the beginning of 2000 have forced an increasing number of people to seek refuge in Internally Displaced Persons� (IDP) Camps called �Protected Villages,� or, alternatively, in the towns of Gulu and Kitgum.� According to the World Food Program (WFP), 26.4 percent of the IDPs living in camps are children aged five to 14 years old.� The majority of these children have been out of school since the conflict escalated in July 1996.� Although national primary enrollment averages 95 percent for all children aged six to 13 years, less than 30 percent of school-age children in IDP camps are currently enrolled on a full-time basis, with young girls especially affected.   According to the Uganda People�s Defense Forces (UPDF) Fourth Division Commander in Gulu, over 300,000 children in northern Uganda are unable to go to school at present.� Low enrollment and retention in war-affected areas is the result of several complex and interrelated factors.� Stress levels among children have dramatically increased because of displacement, separation, death, violence, abduction and sexual abuse.� For formerly abducted children and child soldiers this trauma is particularly acute.� Girls are especially affected, as they often return from captivity with babies.� In addition, both former child soldiers and war-affected children returning to school after a long absence find themselves in the difficult position of being older than their classmates and having missed years of schooling.� This situation leads them to either not return to school, or to drop out after they re-enroll.   Despite government incentives to local teachers and a teacher training college located in Gulu, northern Uganda is also suffering from a shortage of educators.� The few remaining teachers are often unequipped to accommodate the many special needs of their students.�� Furthermore, for many children, the cost of purchasing school supplies and the opportunity cost of attending school is too great.� Although some young people have expressed an interest in learning skills or a trade, most technical training colleges require a level of academic achievement that former child soldiers and war-affected children have not attained.� Furthermore, many young people lack the basic literacy skills needed to succeed in formal training programs.�   Nonetheless, the commitment to and desire for education among these young people and their communities is considerable.� Education is often the top priority identified by communities immediately following an attack or displacement.� The Government of Uganda has responded through the provision of several new policies and programs.� The Ministry of Education has drafted strategies for working with children living in areas of conflict in a Basic Education Policy and Costed Framework For Educationally Disadvantaged Children.� The policy aims to increase community participation in education; strengthen linkages between formal and non-formal education; improve education quality by ensuring appropriate infrastructure and curriculum content and methodology, and provide appropriate learning materials.� The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Gender, Labour, and Social Development have established a multi-agency working group to address the needs of children who have suffered from armed conflict.� Several international and local NGOs have also developed programs focusing on the rehabilitation and reintegration of former child soldiers and war-affected children.   However, there is a great need to expand and improve upon efforts to educate and train former child soldiers and war-affected children.� The work undertaken by government entities and international and local NGOs working on the ground provide a solid foundation, but gaps remain in current efforts to provide access to quality education. Areas requiring further development include: (1) non-formal education, catch-up classes, and basic literacy training (2) skills and vocational training, (3) teacher training and recruitment, (4) the development of appropriate curricula, materials and teaching methods and the provision of school supplies, and (5) community mobilization and sensitization to meet the education needs and psychosocial needs of children and adolescents in northern Uganda.� The funding provided by this solicitation encourages applicants to propose solid approaches that will address these needs.��   Given the complex unique social situation of these children, USDOL encourages collaboration with programs in northern Uganda working on issues of poverty, health and nutrition, community development, peace and security.� USDOL encourages models that work within existing government structures and national plans of action.� USDOL seeks to fund sustainable programs that provide for the emerging educational needs of these children as northern Uganda transitions towards peace.� Applicants should be ready to adapt services to accommodate the fluidity and constantly changing nature of the security situation, and related migration flows.�   IV. ����� REQUIREMENTS   A. ������ STATEMENT OF WORK   Taking into account the challenges to educating working children in each country of interest, the applicant shall propose and implement creative and innovative approaches to provide educational opportunities to children engaged in or removed from child labor, particularly the worst forms.� The expected outcomes/results of the project are to: 1) increase educational opportunities (enrollment) for children who are engaged in, at risk of, and/or removed from child labor, particularly its worst forms; 2) encourage retention in, and completion of educational programs; and 3) expand the successful transition of children in non-formal education into formal schools or vocational programs.   In the course of implementation, each project shall promote the goals of USDOL's Child Labor Education Initiative listed in Section III.A above.� Because of the limited available resources under this award, applicants should implement programs that complement existing efforts and, where appropriate, replicate or enhance successful models to serve expanded numbers of children and communities.� In order to avoid duplication, enhance collaboration, expand impact, and develop synergies, the grant awardee (hereafter referred to as "Grantee") should work cooperatively with national stakeholders in developing project interventions.   Although USDOL is open to all proposals for innovative solutions to address the challenges of providing increased access to education to the children targeted, the applicant must, at a minimum, prepare responses following the outline of a preliminary project document presented in Appendix A.� This response will be the foundation for the final project document that will be approved after award of the grant.   Note To Timebound Applicants:   In preparing responses for the Dominican Republic and the Philippines, the applicant should be aware that the funding provided by this award is part of USDOL commitments to comprehensive and integrated Timebound Programs to prevent and remove children from the worst forms of child labor.� The Grantee will be required to integrate and closely coordinate the project's interventions with the strategies and activities developed by the ILO/IPEC and the Governments of the Dominican Republic and the Philippines.�   Achieving seamless integration between program components will require working with the same target groups/number of children, to the greatest degree possible with the same children, and in the same geographical areas identified in the ILO-IPEC Timebound Program documents.� Applicants are strongly encouraged to read and become familiar with the design elements of the Timebound Programs funded through ILO/IPEC in the Dominican Republic and the Philippines before preparing a response to this solicitation, and strengthen the quality rather than duplicate activities that are already being funded.�� Applicants should carefully study the ILO/IPEC Timebound project documents in the Dominican Republic and the Philippines available at http://www.dol.gov/ILAB/grants/sga0301/bkgrdSGA0301.htm to become familiar with the education interventions ILO/IPEC will be implementing before proposing their own.� Applicants should avoid duplicating activities being carried out by ILO/IPEC, but are highly encouraged to propose approaches that could complement and improve the quality and impact of ILO/IPEC education interventions.��   In the Philippines, target children include those at risk of work or working in agriculture, deep-sea fishing, domestic service, commercial sexual exploitation, mining and quarrying, and pyrotechnics.� The geographical coverage of the program in the Philippines will include the following regions and provinces: Region III (Bulacan), Region V (Camaranies Norte), Region VI (Ilo Ilo and Negros Occidental), Region VII (Negros Oriental and Cebu), Region XI (Davao), and the National Capital Region (Metro Manila).� Applicants are strongly encouraged to focus their major interventions in facilitating mainstreaming into formal education for children withdrawn from work or at risk of working; strengthening formal education to prevent drop out of identified vulnerable children into child labor; and providing an approach to improve quality in non-formal education so as to better transition children removed from child labor to formal education or vocational options.   In the Dominican Republic, the Consejo Nacional de Trabajo (The National Committee on the Eradication of Child Labor) has defined specific geographic areas for the Timebound Program: Santo Domingo, Duarte, La Vega, Maria Trinidad Sanchez, Monse�or Nouel, Puerto Plata, Sanchez-Ramirez and Saman�.� Also, child labor Timebound Program activities aimed at the worst forms of child labor are already underway in Boca Chica and Constanza.� The Committee has defined commercial sexual exploitation, hazardous informal work, and hazardous agricultural activities as the worst forms of child labor.� Approaches should address the gaps and barriers to education faced by children in these forms of employment in the Dominican Republic.   In Timebound Programs, key personnel will work closely with the ILO/IPEC's National Program Manager and the Timebound Program Chief Technical Adviser, and as appropriate, with staff of the national government in developing project interventions.�   Note to All Applicants:�   The Grantee is expected to consult with and work cooperatively with stakeholders in the countries, including the Ministries of Education and Labor, NGOs, national steering/advisory committees on child labor education, faith-based organizations, and working children and their families.� Where practical, there should be efforts to work with existing projects, particularly those funded by USDOL.   B. ������ DELIVERABLES   In addition to meeting the above requirements, the Grantee will be expected to monitor the implementation of the program, report to USDOL on a quarterly basis, and undergo evaluation of program results.� Guidance on USDOL procedures and management requirements will be provided to the Grantee in written Management Procedures and Guidelines (MPG) after award.� The project budget must include funds to plan, implement and evaluate programs and activities, conduct various studies pertinent to project implementation, to establish education baselines to measure program results, and travel to meet with USDOL officials in Washington at yearly intervals.� Corresponding indicators of performance will also be developed by the Grantee and approved by USDOL.� Unless otherwise indicated, the Grantee must submit copies of all required reports to ILAB by the specified due dates.� Specific deliverables are the following:   1. Project design document   The Grantee will prepare a preliminary project document in the format described in Appendix A, with design elements linked to a logical framework matrix.� See http://www.dol.gov/ILAB/grants/sga0301/bkgrdSGA0301.htm for a worked example.� The project document will include a background/justification section, project strategy (goal, purpose, outputs, activities, indicators, means of verification, assumptions), project implementation timetable and project budget.� The narrative will address the criteria/themes described in Section V.B.1 below Program Design/Budget-Cost Effectiveness.� The final project design document will be based on the application written in response to this solicitation, but will include the results of additional consultation with stakeholders, partners, and ILAB.� The document will also include sections that address coordination strategies, project management and sustainability.� The final project document will be delivered three months after the time of the award.   2. Technical and financial progress reports   The format for the technical progress report will be provided in the MPG distributed after the award.� The Grantee must furnish a typed technical report to ILAB on a quarterly basis by 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December.� Technical reports will include: For each project objective, an accurate account of activities carried out under that objective during the reporting period; A description of current problems that may impede performance, and proposed corrective action; Future actions planned in support of each project objective; Aggregate amount of costs incurred during the reporting period relative to each objective; and Progress on common Government Performance and Results Act indicators (to be reported semi-annually) to be provided to Grantees after award.�   The Grantee must also furnish separate financial reports (SF 272 and 269) to ILAB on the quarterly basis mentioned above.   3.
