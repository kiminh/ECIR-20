Granholm and Habitat for Humanity International (HBHI) today announced that the international organization’s signature event will be held in Michigan in 2005.   At press conferences in Detroit and Benton Harbor, Granholm and Habitat for Humanity International Founder and President Millard Fuller declared Detroit and Benton Harbor host cities for the 2005 Jimmy Carter Work Project (JCWP).  The builds will be held in each city from June 19 to June 24, 2005.   Granholm and Fuller will join the former President and 2002 Noble Peace Prize laureate, along with his wife Rosalynn and an estimated 3,000 volunteers from the U.S. and around the world, as they build houses in partnership with families in need.   “Habitat for Humanity’s focus on Detroit and Benton Harbor demonstrates the importance of all of our citizens working together to build homes, to build lives, and most importantly, to build bridges between us,’’ said Granholm.  “We appreciate their support and look forward to working with them.’’   Carter has been a long-time supporter of the nonprofit, nondenominational Christian housing organization.  He became actively involved with it after leaving office in 1981.   Carter hosts a JCWP every year somewhere in the world.  In 2002, he built homes in Durban, South Africa; in 2003, he is building homes in Georgia and Alabama; next year, he will build homes in Mexico.   Detroit and Benton Harbor had been under consideration by Habitat officials as potential sites since early in the year.  The housing needs in those communities and the presence of strong Habitat affiliates were deciding factors.   “The Jimmy Carter Work Project provides a wonderful opportunity to continue to strengthen and build Habitat’s ministry across the state of Michigan and engage people from all walks of life to volunteer and come together to eliminate poverty housing from Michigan and the world,’’  said Fuller.      The state of Michigan has strong ties to Habitat for Humanity.  Since 1986, Habitat Detroit has helped to house more than 100 families in the city of Detroit.  Michigan has 80 Habitat affiliates, more than any other state.  Michigan State University has the largest Habitat for Humanity student chapter in the world.  The Michigan Department of Corrections Prison Build is also the largest prison build program in the world.  (The Prison Build Program builds the door frames, window frames, walls, and some cabinetry.)  Whirlpool Corporation, headquartered in Benton Harbor/St. Joseph, provides appliances (stoves and refrigerators) for every Habitat home built in the United States.  The Michigan State Housing Development Authority has provided over $20 million (over a several year period) to Habitat affiliates to help homeowners buy-down the cost of their homes by $10,000 per home.   Since 1976, Habitat has built more than 150,000 houses in more than 89 countries, including some 50,000 houses across the United States.               Related Content > Budget Deal Reached to Eliminate Budget Deficit > Governor Granholm Announces Appointment to Council of Economic ... > Governor Granholm Signs Key Land Use Bills > Governor Granholm Appoints Francis "Bus" Spaniola to the ... > Governor Proclaims 2003 a Year of Economic Victories > Governor Granholm Announces Appointments to the Michigan ... > Governor Granholm Establishes Mental Health Commission > Governor Granholm Issues Proclamation Lowering Flags for ... > Governor Granholm Announces Judicial Appointments > Governor Granholm Proposes Funding to Bring Guardsmen Home for ... > Governor Appoints Barbara Brown Judge of the 92nd Judicial ... > Executive Order Presented to Balance '04 Budget Michigan.gov Home  |  Home  |  State Web Sites  |  Contact Michigan Privacy Policy  |  Link Policy  |  Accessibility Policy  |  Security Policy Copyright © 2001-2003 State of Michigan
