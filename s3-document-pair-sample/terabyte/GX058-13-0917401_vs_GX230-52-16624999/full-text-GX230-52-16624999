Fraud increases the cost of health care for everyone. Anyone who intentionally makes a false statement or a false claim in order to obtain FEHB benefits or increase the amount of FEHB benefits is subject to prosecution for FRAUD. This could result in CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Please review all medical bills, medical records and claims statements carefully. If you find that a provider, such as a doctor, hospital or pharmacy, charged your plan for services you did not receive, billed for the same service twice, or misrepresented any other information, take the following actions: � Call the provider and ask for an explanation � sometimes the problem is a simple error. � If the provider does not resolve the matter, or if you remain concerned, call your plan at 1-800-462-6633 and explain the situation. � If the matter is not resolved after speaking to your plan (and you still suspect fraud has been committed), call or write: THE HEALTH CARE FRAUD HOTLINE 202/418-3300 The Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General Fraud Hotline 1900 E Street N.W., Room 6400 Washington, DC 20415 The inappropriate use of membership identification cards, e.g., to obtain services for a person who is not an eligible family member or after you are no longer enrolled in the Plan, is also subject to review by the Inspector General and may result in an adverse administrative action by your agency. General Information Confidentiality Medical and other information provided to the Plan, including claim files, is kept confidential and will be used only: 1) by the Plan and its subcontractors for internal administration of the Plan, coordination of benefit provisions with other plans, and subrogation of claims; 2) by law enforcement officials with authority to investigate and prosecute alleged civil or criminal actions; 3) by OPM to review a disputed claim or perform its contract administration functions; 4) by OPM and the General Accounting Office when conducting audits as required by the FEHB law; or 5) for bona fide medical research or education. Medical data that does not identify individual members may be disclosed as a result of the bona fide medical research or education. Use this brochure as a guide to coverage and obtaining benefits. There may be a delay before you receive your identification card and member information from the Plan. Until you receive your ID card, you may show your copy of the SF 2809 enrollment form or your annuitant confirmation letter from OPM to a provider or Plan facility as proof of enrollment in this Plan. If you do not receive your ID card within 60 days after the effective date of your enrollment, you should contact the Plan. If you made your open season change by using Employee Express and have not received your new ID card by the effective date of your enrollment, call the Employee Express HELP number to request a confirmation letter. Use that letter to confirm your new coverage with Plan providers. If you are a new member of this Plan, benefits and rates begin on the effective date of your enrollment, as set by your employing office or retirement system. As a member of this Plan, once your enrollment is effective, you will be covered only for services provided or arranged by a Plan doctor except in the case of emergency as described on page 13. If you are confined in a hospital on the effective date, you must notify the Plan so that it may arrange for the transfer of your care to Plan providers. See "If you are hospitalized" on page 3. FEHB plans may not refuse to provide benefits for any condition you or a covered family member may have solely on the basis that it was a condition that existed before you enrolled in a plan under the FEHB Program except as stated in any cosmetic surgery or dental benefits description in this brochure. 2 If you are a new member General Information If you are hospitalized continued If you change plans or options, benefits under your prior plan or option cease on the effective date of your enrollment in your new plan or option, unless you or a covered family member are confined in a hospital or other covered facility or are receiving medical care in an alternative care setting on the last day of your enrollment under the prior plan or option. In that case, the confined person will continue to receive benefits under the former plan or option until the earliest of (1) the day the person is discharged from the hospital or other covered facility (a move to an alternative care setting does not constitute a discharge under this provision), or (2) the day after the day all inpatient benefits have been exhausted under the prior plan or option, or (3) the 92nd day after the last day of coverage under the prior plan or option. However, benefits for other family members under the new plan will begin on the effective date. If your plan terminates participation in the FEHB Program in whole or in part, or if the Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance orders an enrollment change, this continuation of coverage provision does not apply; in such case, the hospitalized family member 's benefits under the new plan begin on the effective date of enrollment. It is your responsibility to be informed about your health benefits. Your employing office or retirement system can provide information about: when you may change your enrollment; who "family members" are; what happens when you transfer, go on leave without pay, enter military service, or retire; when your enrollment terminates; and the next open season for enrollment. Your employing office or retirement system will also make available to you an FEHB Guide, brochures and other materials you need to make an informed decision. � The benefits in this brochure are effective on January 1 for those already enrolled in this Plan; if you changed plans or plan options, see "If you are a new member" above. In both cases, however, the Plan's new rates are effective the first day of the enrollee's first full pay period that begins on or after January 1 (January 1 for all annuitants). � Generally, you must be continuously enrolled in the FEHB Program for the last five years before you retire to continue your enrollment for you and any eligible family members after you retire. � The FEHB Program provides Self Only coverage for the enrollee alone or Self and Family coverage for the enrollee, his or her spouse, and unmarried dependent children under age 22. Under certain circumstances, coverage will also be provided under a family enrollment for a disabled child 22 years of age or older who is incapable of self-support. � An enrollee with Self Only coverage who is expecting a baby or the addition of a child may change to a Self and Family enrollment up to 60 days after the birth or addition. The effective date of the enrollment change is the first day of the pay period in which the child was born or became an eligible family member. The enrollee is responsible for his or her share of the Self and Family premium for that time period; both parent and child are covered only for care received from Plan providers. � You will not be informed by your employing office (or your retirement system) or your Plan when a family member loses eligibility. � You must direct questions about enrollment and eligibility, including whether a dependent age 22 or older is eligible for coverage, to your employing office or retirement system. The Plan does not determine eligibility and cannot change an enrollment status without the necessary information from the employing agency or retirement system. � An employee, annuitant, or family member enrolled in one FEHB plan is not entitled to receive benefits under any other FEHB plan. � Report additions and deletions (including divorces) of covered family members to the Plan promptly. � If you are an annuitant or former spouse with FEHB coverage and you are also covered by Medicare Part B, you may drop your FEHB coverage and enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan when one is available in your area. If you later change your mind and want to reenroll in FEHB, you may do so at the next open season, or whenever you involuntarily lose coverage in the Medicare prepaid plan or move out of the area it serves. 3 Your responsibility Things to keep in mind General Information continued Most Federal annuitants have Medicare Part A. If you do not have Medicare Part A, you may enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan, but you will probably have to pay for hospital coverage in addition to the Part B premium. Before you join the plan, ask whether they will provide hospital benefits and, if so, what you will have to pay. You may also remain enrolled in this Plan when you join a Medicare prepaid plan. Contact your local Social Security Administration (SSA) office for information on local Medicare prepaid plans (also known as Coordinated Care Plans or Medicare HMOs) or request it from SSA at 1-800/638-6833. Contact your retirement system for information on dropping your FEHB enrollment and changing to a Medicare prepaid plan. � Federal annuitants are not required to enroll in Medicare Part B (or Part A) in order to be covered under the FEHB Program nor are their FEHB benefits reduced if they do not have Medicare Part B. Coverage after enrollment ends When an employee's enrollment terminates because of separation from Federal service or when a family member is no longer eligible for coverage under an employee or annuitant enrollment, and the person is not otherwise eligible for FEHB coverage, he or she generally will be eligible for a free 31day extension of coverage. The employee or family member may also be eligible for one of the following: When a Federal employee or annuitant divorces, the former spouse may be eligible to elect coverage under the spouse equity law. If you are recently divorced or anticipate divorcing, contact the employee's employing office (personnel office) or retiree's retirement system to get more facts about electing coverage. If you are an employee whose enrollment is terminated because you separate from service, you may be eligible to temporarily continue your health benefits coverage under the FEHB Program in any plan for which you are eligible. Ask your employing office for RI 79-27, which describes TCC, and for RI 70-5, the FEHB Guide for individuals eligible for TCC. Unless you are separated for gross misconduct, TCC is available to you if you are not otherwise eligible for continued coverage under the Program. For example, you are eligible for TCC when you retire if you are unable to meet the five-year enrollment requirement for continuation of enrollment after retirement. Your TCC begins after the initial free 31-day extension of coverage ends and continues for up to 18 months after your separation from service (that is, if you use TCC until it expires 18 months following separation, you will only pay for 17 months of coverage). Generally, you must pay the total premium (both the Government and employee shares) plus a 2 percent administrative charge. If you use your TCC until it expires, you are entitled to another free 31-day extension of coverage when you may convert to nongroup coverage. If you cancel your TCC or stop paying premiums, the free 31day extension of coverage and conversion option are not available. Children or former spouses who lose eligibility for coverage because they no longer qualify as family members (and who are not eligible for benefits under the FEHB Program as employees or under the spouse equity law) also may qualify for TCC. They also must pay the total premium plus the 2 percent administrative charge. TCC for former family members continues for up to 36 months after the qualifying event occurs, for example, the child reaches age 22 or the date of the divorce. This includes the free 31-day extension of coverage. When their TCC ends (except by cancellation or nonpayment of premium), they are entitled to another free 31-day extension of coverage when they may convert to nongroup coverage. NOTE: If there is a delay in processing the TCC enrollment, the effective date of the enrollment is still the 32nd day after regular coverage ends. The TCC enrollee is responsible for premium payments retroactive to the effective date and coverage may not exceed the 18 or 36 month period noted above. Former spouse coverage Temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) 4 General Information continued Notification and election requirements: Separating employees � Within 61 days after an employee's enrollment terminates because of separation from service, his or her employing office must notify the employee of the opportunity to elect TCC. The employee has 60 days after separation (or after receiving the notice from the employing office, if later) to elect TCC. Children � You must notify your employing office or retirement system when a child becomes eligible for TCC within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs, for example, the child reaches age 22 or marries. Former spouses � You or your former spouse must notify the employing office or retirement system of the former spouse's eligibility for TCC within 60 days after the termination of the marriage. A former spouse may also qualify for TCC if, during the 36-month period of TCC eligibility, he or she loses spouse equity eligibility because of remarriage before age 55 or loss of the qualifying court order. This applies even if he or she did not elect TCC while waiting for spouse equity coverage to begin. The former spouse must contact the employing office within 60 days of losing spouse equity eligibility to apply for the remaining months of TCC to which he or she is entitled. The employing office or retirement system has 14 days after receiving notice from you or the former spouse to notify the child or the former spouse of his or her rights under TCC. If a child wants TCC, he or she must elect it within 60 days after the date of the qualifying event (or after receiving the notice, if later). If a former spouse wants TCC, he or she must elect it within 60 days after any of the following events: the date of the qualifying event or the date he or she receives the notice, whichever is later; or the date he or she loses coverage under the spouse equity law because of remarriage before age 55 or loss of the qualifying court order. Important: The employing office or retirement system must be notified of a child's or former spouse's eligibility for TCC within the 60-day time limit. If the employing office or retirement system is not notified, the opportunity to elect TCC ends 60 days after the qualifying event in the case of a child and 60 days after the change in status in the case of a former spouse. Conversion to individual coverage When none of the above choices are available � or chosen � when coverage as an employee or family member ends, or when TCC coverage ends (except by cancellation or nonpayment of premium), you may be eligible to convert to an individual, nongroup contract. You will not be required to provide evidence of good health and the plan is not permitted to impose a waiting period or limit coverage for preexisting conditions. If you wish to convert to an individual contract, you must apply in writing to the carrier of the plan in which you are enrolled within 31 days after receiving notice of the conversion right from your employing agency. A family member must apply to convert within the 31-day free extension of coverage that follows the event that terminates coverage, e.g., divorce or reaching age 22. Benefits and rates under the individual contract may differ from those under the FEHB Program. Facts About This Plan This Plan is a comprehensive medical plan, sometimes called a health maintenance organization (HMO). When you enroll in an HMO, you are joining an organized system of health care that arranges in advance with specific doctors, hospitals and other providers to give care to members and pays them directly for their services. Because the Plan provides or arranges your care and pays the cost, it seeks efficient and effective delivery of health services. By controlling unnecessary or inappropriate care, it can afford to offer a comprehensive range of benefits. In addition to providing comprehensive health services and benefits for accidents, illness and injury, the Plan emphasizes preventive benefits such as office visits, physicals, immunizations and well-baby care. You are encouraged to get medical attention at the first sign of illness. 5 Facts About This Plan Who Provides care to Plan members? Role of a primary care doctor continued CIGNA HealthCare CoMED HMO is an individual practice association (IPA) type HMO contracting with associations of doctors and with individual doctors to provide services to members. There are more than 3,900 doctors participating, all from their private offices in the community. Each family member may choose a different primary care doctor located anywhere in the Service Area. The first and most important decision each member must make is the selection of a primary care doctor. The decision is important since it is through this doctor that all other health services, particularly those of specialists, are obtained. It is the responsibility of your primary care physician to obtain any necessary authorization from the Plan before referring you to a specialist, or making arrangements for hospitalization. Services of other providers are covered only when there has been a referral by the member 's primary care doctor with the following exception: a woman may see her Plan obstetrician/gynecologist for her annual well-woman exam without a referral. The Plan's provider directory lists primary care doctors (generally family practitioners, pediatricians, and internists) with their locations and phone numbers, and notes whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients. Directories are updated on a regular basis and are available at the time of enrollment or upon request by calling the Member Services Department at 201/361-1020, or if a toll call in New Jersey, 800/462-6633. You can also find out if your doctor participates with this Plan by calling this number. If you are interested in receiving care from a specific provider who is listed in the directory, call the provider to verify that he or she still participates with the Plan and is accepting new patients. Important note: When you enroll in this plan, services (except for emergency benefits) are provided through the Plan's delivery system; the continued availability and/or participation of any one doctor, hospital, or other provider, cannot be guaranteed. Should you decide to enroll, you will be asked to choose a primary care doctor for you and each member of your family and to notify the Plan of your selection(s). You can select a different primary care physician for each member of your family. To select/change primary care physicians, just call Member Services at 800/462-6633. In the event a member is receiving services from a doctor who terminates a participation agreement, the Plan will provide payment for covered services until the Plan can make reasonable and medically appropriate provisions for the assumption of such services by a participating doctor. Choosing your doctor Referrals for specialty care Except in a medical emergency, or when a primary care doctor has designated another doctor to see patients when he or she is unavailable, you must receive a referral from your primary care doctor before seeing any other doctor or obtaining special services. Referral to a participating specialist is given at the primary care doctor 's discretion; if specialists or consultants are required beyond those participating in the Plan, the primary care doctor will make arrangements for appropriate referrals. When you receive a referral from your primary care doctor, you must return to the primary care doctor after the consultation. All follow-up care must be provided or authorized by the primary care doctor. On referrals, the primary care doctor will give specific instructions to the consultant as to what services are authorized. If additional services or visits are suggested by the consultant, you must check first with your primary care doctor. Do not go to the specialist unless your primary care doctor has arranged for and the Plan has issued an authorization for the referral in advance. Authorizations For new members Your primary care doctor must obtain authorization from the Medical Director before you may be hospitalized, referred for specialty care or obtain follow-up care from a specialist. If you are already under the care of a specialist who is a Plan participant, you must still obtain a referral from a Plan primary care doctor for care to be covered by the Plan. If the doctor who originally referred you prior to your joining this Plan is now your Plan primary care doctor, you need only call to explain that you now belong to this Plan and ask that a "referral form" be sent to the specialist for your next appointment. If you are selecting a new primary care doctor, you must schedule an appointment so the primary care doctor can decide whether to treat the condition directly or refer you back to the specialist. Hospital care 6 If you require hospitalization, your primary care doctor or authorized specialist will make the necessary arrangements and continue to supervise your care. Facts About This Plan Out-of-pocket maximum continued few benefits. However, copayments will not be required for the after your out-of-pocket expenses for services provided or arranged by Only enrollment or $3,000 per Self and Family. This out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs.

You are assured a predictable maximum in out-ofpocket costs for covered health and medical needs. Copayments are due when service is rendered. Deductible carryover If you changed to this Plan during open season from a plan with a deductible and the effective date of the change was after January 1, any expenses that would have applied to that plan's deductible will be covered by your old plan if they are for care you got in January before the effective date of your coverage in this Plan. If you have already met the deductible in full, your old plan will reimburse these covered expenses. If you have not met it in full, your old plan will first apply your covered expenses to satisfy the rest of the deductible and then reimburse you for any additional covered expenses. The old plan will pay these covered expenses according to this year 's benefits; benefit changes are effective January 1. When you are required to submit a claim to this Plan for covered expenses, submit your claim promptly. The Plan will not pay benefits for claims submitted later than December 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred, unless timely filing was prevented by administrative operations of Government or legal incapacity, provided the claim was submitted as soon as reasonably possible. Plan providers will follow generally accepted medical practice in prescribing any course of treatment. Before you enroll in this Plan, you should determine whether you will be able to accept treatment or procedures that may be recommended by Plan providers. The service area for this Plan, where Plan providers and facilities are located, is the same as the enrollment area listed on the front cover of this brochure (the area in which you must live to enroll in the Plan). Benefits for care outside the service area are limited to emergency services, as described on page 13. If you or a covered family member move outside the enrollment area, you may enroll in another approved plan. It is not necessary to wait until you move or for the open season to make such a change; contact your employing office or retirement system for information if you are anticipating a move. Submit claims promptly Other considerations The Plan's service and enrollment areas Reciprocity When you or a covered dependent need urgent but within another CIGNA HealthCare service other CIGNA affiliated HMOs. Please contact from another CIGNA HealthCare participating medical care while outside of your Plan's service area area, care may be arranged through any one of the Member Services so that you may receive services provider. General Limitations Important notice Although a specific service may be listed as a benefit, it will be covered for you only if, in the judgment of your Plan doctor, it is medically necessary for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your illness or condition. No oral statement of any person shall modify or otherwise affect the benefits, limitations and exclusions of this brochure, convey or void any coverage, increase or reduce any benefits under this Plan or be used in the prosecution or defense of a claim under this Plan. This brochure is based on text included in the contract between OPM and this Plan and is intended to be a complete statement of benefits available to FEHB members. You should use this brochure to determine your entitlement to benefits. However, if conflicts are discovered between the language of this brochure and the contract, the contract will control. In the event of major disaster, epidemic, war, riot, civil insurrection, disability number of Plan providers, complete or partial destruction of facilities, or other the Plan's control, the Plan will make a good faith effort to provide or arrange However, the Plan will not be responsible for any delay or failure in providing available facilities or personnel. of a significant circumstances beyond for covered services. service due to lack of 7 Circumstances beyond Plan Control General Limitations Other sources of benefits Medicare continued This section applies when you or your family members are entitled to benefits from a source other than this Plan.

Information about the other coverage must be disclosed to this Plan. When there is double coverage for covered benefits, other than emergency services from non-Plan providers, this Plan will continue to provide its benefits in full, but is entitled to receive payment for the services and supplies provided, to the extent that they are covered by the other coverage, no-fault or other automobile insurance or any other primary plan. One plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payer, and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payer. When this Plan is the secondary payer, it will pay the lesser of (1) its benefits in full, or (2) a reduced amount which, when added to the benefits payable by the other coverage, will not exceed reasonable charges. The determination of which health coverage is primary (pays its benefits first) is made according to guidelines provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When benefits are payable under automobile insurance, including no-fault, the automobile insurer is primary (pays its benefits first) if it is legally obligated to provide benefits for health care expenses without regard to other health benefits coverage the enrollee may have. This provision applies whether or not a claim is filed under the other coverage. When applicable, authorization must be given this Plan to obtain information about benefits or services available from the other coverage, or to recover overpayments from other coverages. CHAMPUS If you are covered by both this Plan and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), this Plan will pay benefits first. As a member of a prepaid plan, special limitations on your CHAMPUS coverage apply; your primary provider must authorize all care. See your CHAMPUS Health Benefits Advisor if you have questions about CHAMPUS coverage. If you are covered by both this Plan and Medicaid, this Plan will pay benefits first. The Plan will not pay for services required as the result of occupational disease or injury for which any medical benefits are determined by the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be payable under workers' compensation (under section 8103 of title 5, U.S.C.) or by a similar agency under another Federal or State law. This provision also applies when a third party injury settlement or other similar proceeding provides medical benefits in regard to a claim under workers' compensation or similar laws. If medical benefits provided under such laws are exhausted, this Plan will be financially responsible for services or supplies that are otherwise covered by this Plan. The Plan is entitled to be reimbursed by OWCP (or the similar agency) for services it provided that were later found to be payable by OWCP (or the agency). Facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and the Indian Health Service are entitled to seek reimbursement from the Plan for certain services and supplies provided to you or a family member to the extent that reimbursement is required under the Federal statutes governing such facilities. The Plan will not provide benefits for services and supplies paid for directly or indirectly by any other local, State, or Federal Government agency.

OPM will not review your request unless you demonstrate that you gave the Plan an opportunity to reconsider your claim. Your written request to the Plan must state why, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure, you believe the denied claim for payment or service should have been paid or provided. Within 30 days after receipt of your request for reconsideration, the Plan must affirm the denial in writing to you, pay the claim, provide the service, or request additional information reasonably necessary to make a determination. If the Plan asks a provider for information it will send you a copy of this request at the same time. The Plan has 30 days after receiving the information to give its decision. If this information is not supplied within 60 days, the Plan will base its decision on the information it has on hand. OPM review If the Plan affirms its denial, you have the right to request a review by OPM to determine whether the Plan's actions are in accordance with the terms of its contract. You must request the review within 90 days after the date of the Plan's letter affirming its initial denial.

Your request must include the following information or it will be returned by OPM: � A copy of your letter to the Plan requesting reconsideration; � A copy of the Plan's reconsideration decision (if the Plan failed to respond, provide instead (a) the date of your request to the Plan or (b) the dates the Plan requested and you provided additional information to the Plan); � Copies of documents that support your claim, such as doctors' letters, operative reports, bills, medical records, and explanation of benefit (EOB) forms; and � Your daytime phone number. 17 How to Obtain Benefits continued Medical documentation received from you or the Plan during the review process becomes a permanent part of the disputed claim file, subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. Send your request for review to: Office of Personnel Management, Office of Insurance Programs, Contracts Division IV, P.O. Box 436, Washington, DC 20044. You (or a person acting on your behalf) may not bring a lawsuit to recover benefits on a claim for treatment, services, supplies or drugs covered by this Plan until you have exhausted the OPM review procedure, established at section 890.105, title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). If OPM upholds the Plan's decision on your claim, and you decide to bring a lawsuit based on the denial, the lawsuit must be brought no later than December 31 of the third year after the year in which the services or supplies upon which the claim is predicated were provided. Pursuant to section 890.107, title 5, CFR, such a lawsuit must be brought against the Office of Personnel Management in Federal court. Federal law exclusively governs all claims for relief in a lawsuit that relates to this Plan's benefits or coverage or payments with respect to those benefits. Judicial action on such claims is limited to the record that was before OPM when it rendered its decision affirming the Plan's denial of the benefit. The recovery in such a suit is limited to the amount of benefits in dispute. Privacy Act statement � If you ask OPM to review a denial of a claim for payment or service, OPM is authorized by chapter 89 of title 5, U.S.C., to use the information collected from you and the Plan to determine if the Plan has acted properly in denying you the payment or service, and the information so collected may be disclosed to you and/or the Plan in support of OPM's decision on the disputed claim. 18 How CIGNA HealthCare/CoMED HMO Changes January 1997 Do not rely on this page; it is not an official statement of benefits. Benefit changes � Durable medical equipment is covered in full. Previously, durable medical equipment was limited. � Under the "Medical and Surgical Benefits" provision, "transplant benefits," heart/lung, and pancreas transplants have been added to the list of covered transplants. Previously, these transplants were not shown as covered. Clarifications � "Nonexperimental implants" is now termed "The insertion of internal prosthetic devices." � The use of a Plan identification card to obtain benefits after you are no longer enrolled in the Plan is a fraudulent action subject to review by the Inspector General. � Medical data that does not identify individual members may be disclosed as a result of bona fide medical research or education. � General information: When a family member is hospitalized on the effective date of an enrollment change and continues to receive benefits under the old plan, benefits under the new plan will begin for other family members on the effective date of the new enrollment. An enrollee with Self Only coverage who is expecting a baby or the addition of a child may change to a Self and Family enrollment up to 60 days after the birth or addition. Annuitants and former spouses with FEHB coverage, and who are covered by Medicare Part B, may join a Medicare prepaid plan if they do not have Medicare Part A, but they will probably have to pay for hospital coverage. They may also remain enrolled under an FEHB plan when they enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan. Federal annuitants are not required to enroll in Medicare Part B in order to be covered under the FEHB Program nor are their FEHB benefits reduced if they do not have Medicare Part B. Temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) for employees or family member who lose eligibility for FEHB coverage includes one free 31-day extension of coverage and may include a second. How these are coordinated has been clarified; notification and election requirements have also been clarified. "Conversion to individual coverage" does not require evidence of good health and the plan is not permitted to impose a waiting period or limit coverage for preexisting conditions; benefits and rates under the individual contract may differ from those under the FEHB Program. Other changes � Enrollees who change their FEHB enrollments using Employee Express may call the Employee Express HELP number to obtain a letter confirming that change if their ID cards do not arrive by the effective date of the enrollment change. � The Plan will not pay for services required as the result of occupational disease or injury for which any medical benefits are determined by the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be payable under workers' compensation. The Plan is entitled to be reimbursed by OWCP for services it provided that were later found to be payable by OWCP. � Disputed claims: If your claim for payment or services is denied by the Plan, ask OPM to review that denial, you must first ask the Plan to reconsider their now request their reconsideration within six months of the denial (previously, do this). This time limit may be extended if you show you were prevented by beyond your control from making your request within the time limit. and you decide to decision. You must you had one year to circumstances Providers, legal counsel, and other interested parties may act as your representative in pursuing payment of a disputed claim only with your written consent. Any lawsuit to recover benefits on a claim for treatment, services, supplies or drugs covered by this Plan must be brought against the Office of Personnel Management in Federal court and only after you have exhausted the OPM review procedure. 19 Summary of Benefits for CIGNA HealthCare/CoMED HMO � 1997 Do not rely on this chart alone.
