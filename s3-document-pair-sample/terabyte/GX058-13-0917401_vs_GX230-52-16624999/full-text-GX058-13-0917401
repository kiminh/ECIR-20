Fraud increases the cost of health care for everyone. Anyone who intentionally makes a false statement or a false claim in order to obtain FEHB benefits or increase the amount of FEHB benefits is subject to prosecution for FRAUD. This could result in CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Please review all medical bills, medical records and claims statements carefully. If you find that a provider, such as a doctor, hospital or pharmacy, charged your plan for services you did not receive, billed for the same service twice, or misrepresented any other information, take the following actions: � Call the provider and ask for an explanation � sometimes the problem is a simple error. � If the provider does not resolve the matter, or if you remain concerned, call your plan at 1- 800/ 634- 4395, or our TDD# 1- 800/ 822- 1215, and explain the situation. � If the matter is not resolved after speaking to your plan (and you still suspect fraud has been committed), call or write: The Health Care Fraud Hotline 202/ 418- 3300 The Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General Fraud Hotline 1900 E Street, N. W., Room 6400 Washington, D. C. 20415 The inappropriate use of membership identification cards, e. g., to obtain services for a person who is not an eligible family member or after you are no longer enrolled in the Plan, is also subject to review by the Inspector General and may result in an adverse administrative action by your agency. General Information Confidentiality Medical and other information provided to the Plan, including claim files, is kept confidential and will be used only: 1) by the Plan and its subcontractors for internal administration of the Plan, coordination of benefit provisions with other plans, and subrogation of claims; 2) by law enforcement officials with authority to investigate and prosecute alleged civil or criminal actions; 3) by OPM to review a disputed claim or perform its contract administration functions; 4) by OPM and the General Accounting Office when conducting audits as required by the FEHB law; or 5) for bona fide medical research or education. Medical data that does not identify individual members may be disclosed as a result of the bona fide medical research or education. If you are a new member Use this brochure as a guide to coverage and obtaining benefits. There may be a delay before you receive your identification card and member information from the Plan. Until you receive your ID card, you may show your copy of the SF 2809 enrollment form or your annuitant confirmation letter from OPM to a provider or Plan facility as proof of enrollment in this Plan. If you do not receive your ID card within 60 days after the effective date of your enrollment, you should contact the Plan. If you made your open season change by using Employee Express and have not received your new ID card by the effective date of your enrollment, call the Employee Express HELP number to request a confirmation letter. Use that letter to confirm your new coverage with Plan providers. If you are a new member of this Plan, benefits and rates begin on the effective date of your enrollment, as set by your employing office or retirement system. As a member of this Plan, once your enrollment is effective, you will be covered only for services provided or arranged by a Plan doctor except in the case of emergency as described on page 16. If you are confined in a hospital on the effective date, you must notify the Plan so that it may arrange for the transfer of your care to Plan providers. See "If you are hospitalized" on page 4. FEHB plans may not refuse to provide benefits for any condition you or a covered family member may have solely on the basis that it was a condition that existed before you enrolled in a plan under the FEHB Program. 4 General Information continued If you are hospitalized If you change plans or options, benefits under your prior plan or option cease on the effective date of your enrollment in your new plan or option, unless you or a covered family member are confined in a hospital or other covered facility or are receiving medical care in an alternative care setting on the last day of your enrollment under the prior plan or option. In that case, the confined person will continue to receive benefits under the former plan or option until the earliest of (1) the day the person is discharged from the hospital or other covered facility ( a move to an alternative care setting does not constitute a discharge under this provision), or (2) the day after the day all inpatient benefits have been exhausted under the prior plan or option, or (3) the 92nd day after the last day of coverage under the prior plan or option. However, benefits for other family members under the new plan will begin on the effective date. If your plan terminates participation in the FEHB Program in whole or in part, or if the Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance orders an enrollment change, this continuation of coverage provision does not apply; in such case, the hospitalized family member's benefits under the new plan begin on the effective date of enrollment. Your responsibility It is your responsibility to be informed about your health benefits. Your employing office or retirement system can provide information about: when you may change your enrollment; who �family members� are; what happens when you transfer, go on leave without pay, enter military service, or retire; when your enrollment terminates; and the next open season for enrollment. Your employing office or retirement system will also make available to you an FEHB Guide, brochures and other materials you need to make an informed decision. Things to keep in mind � The benefits in this brochure are effective on January 1 for those already enrolled in this Plan; if you changed plans or plan options, see �If you are a new member� above. In both cases, however, the Plan's new rates are effective the first day of the enrollee's first full pay period that begins on or after January 1 (January 1 for all annuitants). � Generally, you must be continuously enrolled in the FEHB Program for the last five years before you retire to continue your enrollment for you and any eligible family members after you retire. � The FEHB Program provides Self Only coverage for the enrollee alone or Self and Family coverage for the enrollee, his or her spouse, and unmarried dependent children under age 22. Under certain circumstances, coverage will also be provided under a family enrollment for a disabled child 22 years of age or older who is incapable of self- support. � An enrollee with Self Only coverage who is expecting a baby or the addition of a child may change to a Self and Family enrollment up to 60 days after the birth or addition. The effective date of the enrollment change is the first day of the pay period in which the child was born or became an eligible family member. The enrollee is responsible for his or her share of the Self and Family premium for that time period; both parent and child are covered only for care received from Plan providers, except for emergency benefits. You will not be informed by your employing office (or your retirement system) or your Plan when a family member loses eligibility. � You must direct questions about enrollment and eligibility, including whether a dependent age 22 or older is eligible for coverage, to your employing office or retirement system. The Plan does not determine eligibility and cannot change an enrollment status without the necessary information from the employing agency or retirement system. � An employee, annuitant, or family member enrolled in one FEHB plan is not entitled to receive benefits under any other FEHB plan. � Report additions and deletions (including divorces) of covered family members to the Plan promptly. � If you are an annuitant or former spouse with FEHB coverage and you are also covered by Medicare Part B, you may drop your FEHB coverage and enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan when one is available in your area. If you later change your mind and want to reenroll in FEHB, you may do so at the next open season, or whenever you involuntarily lose coverage in the Medicare prepaid plan or move out of the area it serves. � Most Federal annuitants have Medicare Part A. If you do not have Medicare Part A, you may enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan, but you will probably have to pay for hospital coverage in addition to the Part B premium. Before you join the plan, ask whether they will provide hospital benefits and, if so, what you will have to pay. 5 General Information continued � You may also remain enrolled in this Plan when you join a Medicare prepaid plan. � Contact your local Social Security Administration (SSA) office for information on local Medicare prepaid plans (also known as Coordinated Care Plans or Medicare HMOs) or request it from SSA at 1- 800/ 638- 6833. Contact your retirement system for information on dropping your FEHB enrollment and changing to a Medicare prepaid plan. See page 11 for information on the Medicare prepaid plan offered by this Plan. � Federal annuitants are not required to enroll in Medicare Part B (or Part A) in order to be covered under the FEHB Program nor are their FEHB benefits reduced if they do not have Medicare Part B (or Part A). Coverage after enrollment ends When an employee's enrollment terminates because of separation from Federal service or when a family member is no longer eligible for coverage under an employee or annuitant enrollment, and the person is not otherwise eligible for FEHB coverage, he or she generally will be eligible for a free 31- day extension of coverage. The employee or family member may also be eligible for one of the following: Former spouse coverage When a Federal employee or annuitant divorces, the former spouse may be eligible to elect coverage under the spouse equity law. If you are recently divorced or anticipate divorcing, contact the employee's employing office (personnel office) or retiree's retirement system to get more facts about electing coverage. Certificate of Creditable Coverage Under Federal law, if you lose coverage under the FEHB Program, you should automatically receive a Certificate of Group Health Plan Coverage from the last FEHB Plan to cover you. This certificate, along with any certificates you receive from other FEHB plans you may have been enrolled in, may reduce or eliminate the length of time a preexisting condition clause can be applied to you by a new non- FEHB insurer. If you do not receive a certificate automatically, you must be given one on request. Temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) If you are an employee whose enrollment is terminated because you separate from service, you may be eligible to temporarily continue your health benefits coverage under the FEHB Program in any plan for which you are eligible. Ask your employing office for RI 79- 27, which describes TCC, and for RI 70- 5, the FEHB Guide for individuals eligible for TCC. Unless you are separated for gross misconduct, TCC is available to you if you are not otherwise eligible for continued coverage under the Program. For example, you are eligible for TCC when you retire if you are unable to meet the five- year enrollment requirement for continuation of enrollment after retirement. Your TCC begins after the initial free 31- day extension of coverage ends and continues for up to 18 months after your separation from service (that is, if you use TCC until it expires 18 months following separation, you will only pay for 17 months of coverage). Generally, you must pay the total premium (both the Government and employee shares) plus a 2 percent administrative charge. If you use your TCC until it expires, you are entitled to another free 31- day extension of coverage when you may convert to nongroup coverage. If you cancel your TCC or stop paying premiums, the free 31- day extension of coverage and conversion option are not available. Children or former spouses who lose eligibility for coverage because they no longer qualify as family members (and who are not eligible for benefits under the FEHB Program as employees or under the spouse equity law) also may qualify for TCC. They also must pay the total premium plus the 2 percent administrative charge. TCC for former family members continues for up to 36 months after the qualifying event occurs, for example, the child reaches age 22 or the date of the divorce. This includes the free 31- day extension of coverage. When their TCC ends (except by cancellation or nonpayment of premium), they are entitled to another free 31- day extension of coverage when they may convert to nongroup coverage. NOTE: If there is a delay in processing the TCC enrollment, the effective date of the enrollment is still the 32nd day after regular coverage ends. The TCC enrollee is responsible for premium payments retroactive to the effective date and coverage may not exceed the 18 or 36 month period noted above. 6 General Information continued Notification and election requirements Separating employees � Within 61 days after an employee's enrollment terminates because of separation from service, his or her employing office must notify the employee of the opportunity to elect TCC. The employee has 60 days after separation (or after receiving the notice from the employing office, if later) to elect TCC. Children � You must notify your employing office or retirement system when a child becomes eligible for TCC within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs, for example, the child reaches age 22 or marries. Former spouses � You or your former spouse must notify the employing office or retirement system of the former spouse's eligibility for TCC within 60 days after the termination of the marriage. A former spouse may also qualify for TCC if, during the 36- month period of TCC eligibility, he or she loses spouse equity eligibility because of remarriage before age 55 or loss of the qualifying court order. This applies even if he or she did not elect TCC while waiting for spouse equity coverage to begin. The former spouse must contact the employing office within 60 days of losing spouse equity eligibility to apply for the remaining months of TCC to which he or she is entitled. The employing office or retirement system has 14 days after receiving notice from you or the former spouse to notify the child or the former spouse of his or her rights under TCC. If a child wants TCC, he or she must elect it within 60 days after the date of the qualifying event (or after receiving the notice, if later). If a former spouse wants TCC, he or she must elect it within 60 days after any of the following events: the date of the qualifying event or the date he or she receives the notice, whichever is later; or the date he or she loses coverage under the spouse equity law because of remarriage before age 55 or loss of the qualifying court order. Important: The employing office or retirement system must be notified of a child's or former spouse's eligibility for TCC within the 60- day time limit. If the employing office or retirement system is not notified, the opportunity to elect TCC ends 60 days after the qualifying event in the case of a child and 60 days after the change in status in the case of a former spouse. Conversion to individual coverage When none of the above choices are available � or chosen � when coverage as an employee or family member ends, or when TCC coverage ends (except by cancellation or nonpayment of premium), you may be eligible to convert to an individual, nongroup contract. You will not be required to provide evidence of good health and the plan is not permitted to impose a waiting period or limit coverage for preexisting conditions. If you wish to convert to an individual contract, you must apply in writing to the carrier of the plan in which you are enrolled within 31 days after receiving notice of the conversion right from your employing agency. A family member must apply to convert within the 31- day free extension of coverage that follows the event that terminates coverage, e. g., divorce or reaching age 22. Benefits and rates under the individual contract may differ from those under the FEHB Program. 7 Facts about BlueCHOICE This Plan is a comprehensive medical plan, sometimes called a health maintenance organization (HMO). When you enroll in an HMO, you are joining an organized system of health care that arranges in advance with specific doctors, hospitals and other providers to give care to members and pays them directly for their services. Benefits are available only from Plan providers, except during a medical emergency. Members are required to select a personal doctor from among participating Plan primary care doctors. Most specialty care requires a referral from your selected primary care doctor. There are no claim forms when Plan doctors are used. Your decision to join an HMO should be based on your preference for the plan�s benefits and delivery system, not because a particular provider is in the Plan�s network. You cannot change plans because a provider leaves the HMO. Because the Plan provides or arranges your care and pays the cost, it seeks efficient and effective delivery of health services. By controlling unnecessary or inappropriate care, it can afford to offer a comprehensive range of benefits. In addition to providing comprehensive health services and benefits for accidents, illness and injury, the Plan emphasizes preventive benefits such as office visits, physicals, immunizations and well- baby care. You are encouraged to get medical attention at the first sign of illness. Information you have a right to know All carriers in the FEHB Program must provide certain information to you. If you do not receive information about this Plan, you can obtain it by calling the Carrier at 1- 800/ 634- 4395 or TDD 1- 800/ 822- 1215, or you may write to the Plan at P. O. Box 66828, St. Louis, MO 63166- 6828. Information that must be made available to you includes: � Disenrollment rates for 1997. � Compliance with State and Federal licensing or certification requirements and the dates met. If noncompliant, the reason for noncompliance. � Accreditations by recognized accrediting agencies and the dates received. � Carrier�s type of corporate form and years in existence. � Whether the carrier meets State, Federal and accreditation requirements for fiscal solvency, confidentiality and transfer of medical records. Who provides care to Plan members? This Plan is an individual- practice prepayment Plan. All participating doctors practice in their own offices in the community. Covered benefits are available only from those doctors and from participating hospitals and participating pharmacies. The Plan arranges with doctors and hospitals to provide medical care for both the prevention of disease and the treatment of serious illness. For the treatment of rare or unusual medical cases, the Plan may provide services without geographic limitation. You must select a primary care doctor for each covered family member from the over 809 participating doctors in the Plan's service area. For most care, you must contact your primary care doctor for a referral or authorization before seeing any other doctor, obtaining specialty or hospital services for nonemergency care. A wide variety of Board eligible and Board certified specialists are participating Plan doctors. Your Plan primary doctor admits you to a participating hospital where he/ she has admitting privileges for elective procedures. Role of a primary care doctor The first and most important decision each member must make is the selection of a primary care doctor. The decision is important since it is through this doctor that all other health services, particularly those of specialists, are obtained. It is the responsibility of your primary care doctor to obtain any necessary authorizations from the Plan before referring you to a specialist or making arrangements for hospitalization. Services of other providers are covered only when there has been a referral by the member's primary care doctor with the following exceptions: a woman may see her personal participating obstetrician/ gynecologist directly once in every 365- day period; members can also self- refer to BlueCHOICE network providers for a routine eye exam once in every 365- day period; for mental health and substance treatment and for newborn care (benefit limitations apply). In cases of self- referral, the Plan recommends that you check in advance with it or your primary care doctor to confirm that the services are covered and are medically necessary. 8 Facts about BlueCHOICE continued Choosing your doctor The Plan's provider directory lists general practitioners, pediatricians, and internists, with their locations and phone numbers, and notes whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients. Directories are updated on a regular basis and are available at the time of enrollment or upon request by calling the Client Service department at 1- 800/ 634- 4395 or TDD 1- 800/ 822- 1215; you can also find out if your doctor participates with this Plan by calling this number. If you are interested in receiving care from a specific provider who is listed in the directory, call the provider to verify that he or she still participates with the Plan and is accepting new patients. Important note: When you enroll in this plan, services (except for emergency benefits) are provided through the Plan's delivery system; the continued availability and/ or participation of any one doctor, hospital, or other provider, cannot be guaranteed. Should you decide to enroll, you will be asked to complete a primary care doctor selection form and send it directly to the Plan, indicating the name of the primary care doctor( s) selected for you and each member of your family. Members may change their doctor selection any time by calling the Client Service department. In the event a member is receiving services from a doctor who terminates a participation agreement, the Plan will provide payment for covered services until the Plan can make reasonable and medically appropriate provisions for the assumption of such services by a participating doctor. Referrals for specialty care Except in a medical emergency, or when a primary care doctor has designated another doctor to see patients when he or she is unavailable, you must receive a referral from your primary care doctor before seeing any other doctor or before obtaining most special services (see exceptions below). Referral to a participating specialist is given at the primary care doctor's discretion; if specialists or consultants are required beyond those participating in the Plan, the primary care doctor will make arrangements for appropriate referral. When you receive a referral from your primary care doctor, you must return to the primary care doctor after the consultation. All follow- up care must be provided or arranged by the primary care doctor. On referrals, the primary care doctor will give specific instructions to the consultant as to what services are authorized. If additional services or visits are suggested by the consultant, you must first check with your primary care doctor. Do not go to the specialist unless your primary care doctor has arranged for, and the Plan has issued an authorization for, the referral in advance. If you have a chronic, complex, or serious medical condition that causes you to see a Plan specialist frequently, your primary care doctor will develop a treatment plan with you and your health plan that allows an adequate number of direct access visits with that specialist. The treatment plan will permit you to visit your specialist without the need to obtain further referrals. Exceptions You will only need your primary care physician authorization, not a written referral, to receive benefits for inpatient hospital care, laboratory and X- ray services, mammography screenings and obstetrical ultrasounds at BlueCHOICE facilities. Some types of care do not require a referral or an authorization. You still get benefits as long as you use a BlueCHOICE network provider for routine eye exams and refraction services, well- woman exams, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and newborn exams. Authorizations Your primary care doctor must obtain authorization from the Plan's Medical Director before referring to or hospitalizing you using nonparticipating providers. 9 Facts about BlueCHOICE continued For new members If you are already under the care of a specialist who is a Plan participant, you must still obtain a referral from a Plan primary care doctor for the care to be covered by the Plan. If the doctor who originally referred you prior to your joining this Plan is now your Plan primary care doctor, you need only call to explain that you now belong to this Plan and ask that a "referral form" be sent to the specialist for your next appointment. If you are selecting a new primary care doctor, and want to continue with this specialist, you must schedule an appointment so the primary care doctor can decide whether to treat the condition directly or refer you back to the specialist. Hospital care If you require hospitalization, your primary care doctor or authorized specialist will make the necessary arrangements and continue to supervise your care. Out- of- pocket maximum Copayments are required for a few benefits. However, copayments will not be required for the remainder of the calendar year after your out- of- pocket expenses for services provided or arranged by the Plan reach 100% of annual premium per Self Only enrollment or 100% of annual premium per Self and Family enrollment per calendar year. This copayment maximum does not include costs of prescription drugs. You should maintain accurate records of the copayments made, as it is your responsibility to determine when the copayment maximum is reached. You are assured a predictable maximum in out- of- pocket costs for covered health and medical needs. Copayments are due when service is rendered, except for emergency care. Deductible carryover If you changed to this Plan during open season from a plan with a deductible and the effective date of the change was after January 1, any expenses that would have applied to that plan's deductible will be covered by your old plan if they are for care you got in January before the effective date of your coverage in this Plan. If you have already met the deductible in full, your old plan will reimburse these covered expenses. If you have not met it in full, your old plan will first apply your covered expenses to satisfy the rest of the deductible and then reimburse you for any additional covered expenses. The old plan will pay these covered expenses according to this year's benefits; benefit changes are effective January 1. Submit claims promptly When you are required to submit a claim to this Plan for covered expenses, submit your claim promptly. The Plan will not pay benefits for claims submitted later than December 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred unless timely filing was prevented by administrative operations of Government or legal incapacity, provided the claim was submitted as soon as reasonably possible. Experimental/ investigational determinations A drug, device or biological product is experimental or investigational if the drug, device, or biological product cannot be lawfully marketed without approval of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approval for marketing has not been given at the time it is furnished. Other considerations Plan providers will follow generally accepted medical practice in prescribing any course of treatment. Before you enroll in this Plan, you should determine whether you will be able to accept treatment or procedures that may be recommended by Plan providers. 10 Facts about BlueCHOICE continued The Plan�s service area The service area for this Plan, where Plan providers and facilities are located, is described below. You must live in the service area to enroll in this Plan, however only Illinois residents of Madison and St. Clair counties who work in Missouri may enroll in BlueCHOICE. If you or a covered family member move outside the enrollment area, you may enroll in another approved plan. It is not necessary to wait until you move or for the open season to make such a change; contact your employing office or retirement system for information if you are anticipating a move. Service area: Services from Plan providers are available only in the following areas: The St. Louis Area, including the Missouri counties of Crawford, Franklin, Gasconade, Jefferson, Lincoln, Montgomery, Pike, St. Charles, St. Francois, St. Louis (City and County), Ste. Genevieve, Warren and Washington; the Central Missouri Area counties of: Adair, Audrain, Boone, Callaway, Camden, Chariton, Cole, Cooper, Howard, Linn, Macon, Maries, Miller, Moniteau, Monroe, Morgan, Osage, Phelps, Pulaski, Putnam, Randolph; Schuyler, Sullivan, the Southwest Missouri Area counties of: Barry, Barton, Cedar, Christian, Dade, Dallas, Douglas, Greene, Hickory, Jasper, Laclede, Lawrence, McDonald, Newton, Ozark, Polk, Stone, Taney, Webster, Wright; the Southeast Missouri Area counties of: Butler, Carter, Ripley, Wayne and the Illinois counties of St. Clair and Madison. Reciprocity HMO- USA (Out of State Physician Care) � As a BlueCHOICE customer, you have access to physician care through HMO- USA, a nationwide network of Blue Cross and Blue Shield HMOs. HMO- USA is one of the largest HMO networks in the country, offering coverage in more than 200 U. S. cities. If you become ill while visiting one of these cities, contact the HMO- USA network at 1- 800/ 1- HMO- USA. This number is also found on the back of your ID card. The HMO- USA referral coordinator will schedule an appointment with an HMO- USA physician in the area from which you are calling. No office visit copay will be required and you will not need to file a claim. 11 General Limitations Important notice Although a specific service may be listed as a benefit, it will be covered for you only if, in the judgment of your Plan doctor, it is medically necessary for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your illness or condition. No oral statement of any person shall modify or otherwise affect the benefits, limitations and exclusions of this brochure, convey or void any coverage, increase or reduce any benefits under this Plan or be used in the prosecution or defense of a claim under this Plan. This brochure is the official statement of benefits on which you can rely. Circumstances beyond Plan control In the event of major disaster, epidemic, war, riot, civil insurrection, disability of a significant number of Plan providers, complete or partial destruction of facilities, or other circumstances beyond the Plan's control, the Plan will make a good faith effort to provide or arrange for covered services. However, the Plan will not be responsible for any delay or failure in providing service due to lack of available facilities or personnel. Arbitration of claims Any claim for damages for personal injury, mental disturbance or wrongful death arising out of the rendition of or failure to render services under this contract must be submitted to binding arbitration. Other sources of benefits This section applies when you or your family members are entitled to benefits from a source other than this Plan. You must disclose information about other sources of benefits to the Plan and complete all necessary documents and authorizations requested by the Plan. Medicare If you or a covered family member is enrolled in this Plan and Medicare Part A and/ or Part B, the Plan will coordinate benefits according to Medicare�s determination of which coverage is primary. However, this Plan will not cover services, except those for emergencies, unless you use Plan providers. You must tell your Plan that you or your family member is eligible for Medicare. Generally, that is all you will need to do, unless your Plan tells you that you need to file a Medicare claim. Group health insurance and automobile insurance This coordination of benefits (double coverage) provision applies when a person covered by this Plan also has, or is entitled to benefits from, any other group health coverage, or is entitled to the payment of medical and hospital costs under no- fault or other automobile insurance that pays benefits without regard to fault. Information about the other coverage must be disclosed to this Plan. When there is double coverage for covered benefits, other than emergency services from nonPlan providers, this Plan will continue to provide its benefits in full, but is entitled to receive payment for the services and supplies provided, to the extent that they are covered by the other coverage, no- fault or other automobile insurance or any other primary plan. One plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payer, and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payer. When this Plan is the secondary payer, it will pay the lesser of (1) its benefits in full, or (2) a reduced amount which, when added to the benefits payable by the other coverage, will not exceed reasonable charges. The determination of which health coverage is primary (pays its benefits first) is made according to guidelines provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When benefits are payable under automobile insurance, including no- fault, the automobile insurer is primary (pays its benefits first) if it is legally obligated to provide benefits for health care expenses without regard to other health benefits coverage the enrollee may have. This provision applies whether or not a claim is filed under the other coverage. When applicable, authorization must be given this Plan to obtain information about benefits or services available from the other coverage, or to recover overpayments from other coverages. CHAMPUS If you are covered by both this Plan and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), this Plan will pay benefits first. As a member of a prepaid plan, special limitations on your CHAMPUS coverage apply; your primary care provider must authorize all care. See your CHAMPUS Health Benefits Advisor if you have questions about CHAMPUS coverage. 12 General Limitations continued Medicaid If you are covered by both this Plan and Medicaid, this Plan will pay benefits first. Workers� compensation The Plan will not pay for services required as the result of occupational disease or injury for which any medical benefits are determined by the Office of Workers� Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be payable under workers� compensation (under section 8103 of title 5, U. S. C.) or by a similar agency under another Federal or State law. This provision also applies when a third party injury settlement or other similar proceeding provides medical benefits in regard to a claim under workers� compensation or similar laws.

OPM will not review your request unless you demonstrate that you gave the Plan an opportunity to reconsider your claim. Your written request to the Plan must state why, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure, you believe the denied claim for payment or service should have been paid or provided. Within 30 days after receipt of your request for reconsideration, the Plan must affirm the denial in writing to you, pay the claim, provide the service, or request additional information reasonably necessary to make a determination. If the Plan asks a provider for information it will send you a copy of this request at the same time. The Plan has 30 days after receiving the information to give its decision. If this information is not supplied within 60 days, the Plan will base its decision on the information it has on hand. OPM review If the Plan affirms its denial, you have the right to request a review by OPM to determine whether the Plan's actions are in accordance with the terms of its contract. You must request the review within 90 days after the date of the Plan's letter affirming its initial denial.

OPM must receive a copy of your written consent with their request for review. Your written request for an OPM review must state why, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure, you believe the denied claim for payment or service should have been paid or provided.

Your request must include the following information or it will be returned by OPM: � A copy of your letter to the Plan requesting reconsideration; � A copy of the Plan's reconsideration decision (if the Plan failed to respond, provide instead (a) the date of your request to the Plan or (b) the dates the Plan requested and you provided additional information to the Plan); � Copies of documents that support your claim, such as doctors' letters, operative reports, bills, medical records, and explanation of benefit (EOB) forms; and � Your daytime phone number. 24 CARE MUST BE RECEIVED FROM OR ARRANGED BY PLAN DOCTORS How to Obtain Benefits continued Medical documentation received from you or the Plan during the review process becomes a permanent part of the disputed claim file, subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act.
