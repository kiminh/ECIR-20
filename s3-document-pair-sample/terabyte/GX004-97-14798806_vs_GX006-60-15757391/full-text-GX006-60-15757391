Description: The Three Mile Island station is located on 814 acres of an island near the state capitol at Harrisburg.� Three Mile Island may be the most widely known nuclear power plant in the United States due to an accident to its number 2 reactor.� The second reactor was permanently shut down following an accident on March 28, 1979.�A combination of equipment malfunctions and human error led to a loss of coolant.� It remains the most significant accident on record at a U.S. nuclear power plant. In 2001, unit 1 produced 5.42 billion kilowatthours of electricity while operating at an average capacity factor of 78.8 percent.� Three Mile Island (TMI) is owned by Exelon and by British Energy Co. It is operated by AmerGen Energy Company. Sources: Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, "Annual Electric Generator Report." Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
