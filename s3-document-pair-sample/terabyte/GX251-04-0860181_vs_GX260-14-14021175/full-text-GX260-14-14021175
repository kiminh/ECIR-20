The terms Animal Damage Control, ADC, Wildlife Services, and WS are used synonymously throughout this Environmental Assessment. CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION Across the United States, natural systems are being substantially altered as human populations expand and encroach on wildlife habitats. Human uses and needs often compete with wildlife for space and resources, increasing the potential for conflicting human/wildlife interactions. In addition, segments of the public strive for protection for all wildlife; this protection can create localized conflicts between humans and wildlife activities. The Animal Damage Control (ADC) Programmatic Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) summarizes the relationship in American culture of wildlife values and wildlife damage in this way (USDA 1997a): Wildlife has either positive or negative values, depending on varying human perspectives and circumstances...Wildlife is generally regarded as providing economic, recreational and aesthetic benefits...and the mere knowledge that wildlife exists is a positive benefit to many people. However... the activities of some wildlife may result in economic losses to agriculture and damage to property...Sensitivity to varying perspectives and values are required to manage the balance between human and wildlife needs. In addressing conflicts, wildlife managers must consider not only the needs of those directly affected by wildlife damage but a range of environmental, sociocultural and economic considerations as well. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is authorized and directed by law to protect American agriculture and other resources from damage associated with wildlife. The primary statutory authority for the USDA, Wildlife Services (WS) program is the Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931, as amended (46 Stat. 1468; 7 U.S.C. 426-426b and 426c) and the Rural Development, Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-202). WS activities are conducted in cooperation with other Federal, state and local agencies; and private organizations and individuals. Federal agencies, including the United States Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), recognize the expertise of WS to address wildlife damage issues. Wildlife damage management, or control, is defined as the alleviation of damage or other problems caused by, or related to the presence of wildlife (Leopold 1933, The Wildlife Society 1990, and Berryman 1991). The WS program uses an Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (IWDM) approach (sometimes referred to as "Integrated Pest Management" or IPM) in which a series of methods may be used or recommended to reduce wildlife damage. IWDM is described in Chapter 1, 1-7 of the ADC FEIS (USDA 1997a). These methods include the alteration of cultural practices as well as habitat and behavioral modification to prevent damage. The control of wildlife damage may also require that the offending animal(s) be removed or that localized populations of the offending species be reduced through lethal methods. Potential environmental impacts resulting from the application of various wildlife damage reduction techniques are evaluated in this environmental assessment (EA). According to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), individual actions may be categorically excluded [7 C.F.R. 372.5(c), 60 Fed. Reg. 6,000, 6,003 (1995)]. However, in order to evaluate and determine if there may be any potentially significant or cumulative impacts from the described control program, the Wildlife Services Program in Ohio has decided to prepare this EA. The purpose of this This analysis relies scientific literature, ADC FEIS (USDA EA is to analyze the potential effects of the proposed control activities in the State of Ohio. predominately on existing Federal and State agency publications, information contained in and communications with other wildlife professionals. This EA also cites and is tiered to, the 1997a). All control activities will be in compliance with relevant laws, regulations, policies, orders, and procedures, including the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Control activities will not negatively impact other protected flora or fauna. Notice of availability (NOA) of this document will be made consistent with the Agency's NEPA procedures in order to allow interested parties the opportunity to obtain and review this document and comment on the proposed management activities. Biological carrying capacity is the land or habitat's limit for supporting healthy populations of wildlife without degradation to the animals' health or their environment over an extended period of time (Decker and Purdy 1988). Wildlife acceptance capacity, or cultural carrying capacity, is the limit of human tolerance for wildlife or the maximum number of a given species that can coexist compatibly with local human populations (Decker and Purdy 1988). These terms are especially important in urban areas because they define the sensitivity of a local community to a specific wildlife species. For any given damage situation, there will be varying thresholds by those directly and indirectly affected by the damage. This threshold of damage is a primary limiting factor in determining the cultural carrying capacity. While the State of Ohio has a biological carrying capacity that may support more than the current number of predators, the cultural carrying capacity is often much lower. In many cases when the cultural carrying capacity is reached or exceeded, improper and sometimes illegal implementation of population control methods (e.g., illegal toxicants or unregulated trapping, shooting and snaring) may be used to alleviate predation to livestock and pets and other public health or safety threats (Loker et al. 1999). WILDLIFE SERVICES PROGRAM Wildlife Services (WS) is a cooperatively funded and service oriented program. Before any operational wildlife damage management is conducted, Agreements for Control or WS Work Plans must be completed by WS and the land owner/administrator. WS cooperates with private property owners and managers and with appropriate land and wildlife management agencies, as requested, with the goal of effectively and efficiently resolving wildlife damage problems in compliance with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws and MOU's between WS and other agencies. Wildlife Services' mission, developed through its strategic planning process, is: 1) to provide leadership in wildlife damage management for the protection of American agriculture, endangered and threatened species, and natural resources, and 2) to safeguard public health and safety (USDA 1997b). The WS Policy Manual reflects this mission and provides guidance for engaging in wildlife damage management through: Y Y Y Y Y Y Y close cooperation with other Federal and state agencies; training of wildlife damage management professionals; development and improvement of strategies to reduce losses and threats to publics from wildlife; collection, evaluation, and distribution of wildlife damage management information; cooperative wildlife damage management programs; informing and educating the public on how to reduce wildlife damage and; providing data and a source for limited-use management materials and equipment, including Federal and state registered pesticides. 1.1 PURPOSE The purpose of this EA is to analyze the effects of WS activities in Ohio to reduce predation by coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), feral dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores (e.g., African cats, wolves, etc.) on livestock (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, horses) and poultry (e.g., chickens, turkeys, fowl), referred herein collectively as livestock. Livestock industries most affected by mammalian predators in Ohio are sheep, goat, and cattle. In Ohio, coyotes are non-indigenous, originally ranging in the short grass prairie regions of North America, but have since expanded their range eastward taking advantage of a niche left vacant when red and gray wolves were extirpated (Parker 1995). The first confirmed report of a coyote in Ohio occurred in 1919 (Weeks et al. 1990). Coyotes are the most significant predator of livestock in Ohio, followed by dogs. Historically, feral and free-roaming dogs have been the primary predator of livestock. Today, dog predation on livestock includes pet dogs, feral dogs, and hybrid wolves. Red fox are native to North America; however, they were believed to be native to the spruce-fir forests (Samuel and Nelson 1982). European red fox were brought to North America and released by colonist in the 1600's for sport. Red fox in Ohio are probably a hybrid of North American and European red fox (Samuel and Nelson 1982). While red or gray fox both may prey on livestock, it appears red fox are primarily responsible for livestock predation in Ohio. Although documentation of livestock killed by an escaped exotic carnivore in Ohio is limited, it is important to address this issue. Trade in exotic animals in Ohio is common and laws to regulate inter- and intrastate trade are limited to being disease-free (Ohio Administrative Code [OAC] �901:1-17-12). In addition, possession of exotic animals is not enforced by the state and only some municipalities regulate and enforce laws for possessing exotic animals. 1.2 NEED FOR ACTION Coyote predation on livestock was officially recognized as a threat to Ohio's livestock industry in 1987 with the passage of sections 955.51 to 955.53 of the Ohio Revised Code. Passage of Senate Bill 182 allowed the state funding through the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA), to reimburse livestock owners for confirmed losses due to coyote predation. Between 1991 and 2000, this indemnity program paid Ohio livestock producers approximately $330,000 for losses due to coyotes. During the state's 2000 fiscal year, 182 producers from 49 counties filed claims for 535 animals killed by coyotes, of which 75% involved sheep, cattle, or goats. Depredation claims were geographically dispersed throughout the state and were not specific to a particular region (Ohio Department of Agriculture, unpublished data). National Agriculture Statistics Services (NASS) (2000) reported in 1999 that Ohio was the largest sheep producing state east of the Mississippi River and ranked third in the United States for the number of sheep operations. The most recent data available from NASS estimated the value of livestock losses due to predators in Ohio for sheep was $152,000 in 1999 and for cattle was $292,000 in 1995. The majority of livestock and poultry in Ohio are raised on small farms. The National Commission on Small Farms define small farms as one producing less than $250,000 gross annual receipts. Data provided annually by the NASS indicates that farms generally grossing in excess of $250,000 annually are usually larger than 1,000 acres in size. In Ohio, 97% of all farms are smaller than 1,000 acres and 84% of farms have less than $100,000 in sales. These predation and small farm figures appear to suggest that Ohio farmers may, or have the potential to be severely impacted by livestock losses due to predation. 1.2.1 Summary of Proposed Action The proposed action is to establish a management program to assist livestock producers with reducing losses of sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other livestock to predators in the State of Ohio. An Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (IWDM) approach would be implemented which would allow the use of any legal technique or method, used singly or in combination, to meet requester needs for resolving conflicts with coyotes, red foxes, feral dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores (Appendix B). Cooperators requesting assistance would be provided with information regarding the use of effective non-lethal and lethal techniques. Most non-lethal methods are best implemented by the livestock producer and the following methods may be recommended by WS: guard dogs, llamas, and donkeys; Electronic Predator Guard (Linhart et al. 1992); fencing; moving livestock to other pastures; birthing in buildings; night penning; habitat alteration; herders and scare devices. Additional methods used by WS, or recommended to producers may include shooting, calling and shooting, trapping, snares, dogs, M-44's, Livestock Protection Collars, and gas cartridges. All management actions would comply with appropriate Federal, state, and local laws. The Ohio WS program also will coordinate with the ODA, Division of Animal Industry; Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife (DOW); county extension agents; dog wardens; livestock producers; and others to conduct several educational workshops each year. 1.2.2 Need to Protect Livestock from Mammalian Predators United States: In 2000, NASS (2001) reported livestock inventories and values in the U.S. of 98,048,000 and $67 billion for cattle and calves, 7,026,000 and $668 million for sheep and lambs, 436,000 and $17 million for angora goats, and 59,407,000 and $4.3 billion for hogs and pigs, respectively. Sheep and lamb losses from predators in the U.S. totaled 273,000 and $16.5 million during 1999 (NASS 2000). Coyotes accounted for 60.7% of these predator losses. Similarly, cattle and calf losses from predators in the U.S. totaled 117,400 head and $39.6 million during 1995 (NASS 1996). Coyotes and dogs accounted for 59% and 19% of these predator losses, respectively. Coyotes were also the largest predator of goats, accounting for 35.6% of predator losses (NASS 2000). The value of goats lost from all predators was $3.4 million. Ohio: In 1999, Ohio was the top ranking state in sheep numbers east of the Mississippi River and ranked third in the U.S. in sheep operations with values totaling $17 million (NASS 2000, ODA 1999). Ohio's cattle industry ranked 28th in the nation in inventory with values totaling $923 million in 1999 (ODA 1999). Livestock inventories in January 2000 in Ohio included 1.23 million head of cattle and 134,000 head of sheep. While cattle inventories are at an all-time record low, the sheep inventory increased 7% from 1999-2000 (ODA 1999). Although predation by coyotes, foxes, and dogs to fowl is minimal, egg production is a big business in Ohio. Ohio ranks number 1 in the nation for total laying hen inventory with 40.4 million birds and number of eggs produced with 8.2 billion, or 9.9% of the nations egg supply (ODA 1999). Livestock predation is primarily to sheep, goats, and cattle (Table 1.1). Swine, foals and range raised fowl are occasionally preyed upon by coyotes, foxes, or dogs. Coyotes accounted for 20% of all predator-killed calves in Ohio in 1995 (NASS 1996) and 71% and 67% of all predator-killed ewes and lambs, respectively in Ohio in 1999 (NASS 2000). Dogs accounted for 40% of all predator-killed calves in Ohio in 1995 (NASS 1996) and 29% and 25% of all predator-killed ewes and lambs, respectively in Ohio in 1999 (NASS 2000). Additional costs associated with livestock protection includes labor, lost genetic stock, time (in months or years) to replace lost animals, implementation of wildlife management practices to reduce damage or the threat of damage, and long distance calls to government agencies to seek assistance. From 1989-2000 the Ohio WS program has provided technical assistance or direct control assistance in response to 726 incidents of predation on livestock by coyotes (n = 716), red foxes (n = 5), and feral dogs (n = 5) (unpublished MIS data). 1.2.2.1 Impacts to the Sheep Industry NASS (2000) reported 1,300 and 500 sheep and lambs lost to coyotes and dogs in Ohio, respectively. The lost value of these sheep totaled $152,000 with an average market value at $141/head for sheep and $44/head for lambs. During FY2000, producers were reimbursed from the ODA indemnity program for 191 sheep and 123 lambs lost to coyote predation in 43 counties of Ohio (Table 1.1). Sheep and lambs remain vulnerable to predation throughout the year, particularly from coyotes and dogs (Henne 1977, NASS 1977, 1980, Tigner and Larson 1977, O'Gara et al. 1983). Lambs are vulnerable to red fox predation during the early stages of spring and fall lambing seasons. NASS (2000) reported sheep and lamb losses from animal predators in the U.S. totaled 273,000 during 1999. This represented 36.7% of the total losses from all causes and resulted in a loss of $16.5 million due to predators to farmers and ranchers. Coyotes and dogs accounted for 60.7% and 15.1% of the total sheep and lamb losses to predators, respectively. 1.2.2.2 Impacts to the Cattle Industry NASS (1996) reported 700 cattle and calves lost to predators in Ohio. The lost value of these cattle totaled $292,000 with an average market value at $715/head for adult cattle and $298/head for calves. During FY2000, producers were reimbursed from the ODA indemnity program for 55 cattle lost to coyote predation in 18 counties of Ohio (Table 1.1). Cattle and calves are most vulnerable to predation at calving time and less vulnerable as they get older and larger (Shaw 1977, 1981, Horstman and Gunson 1982). In 1995, NASS (1996) reported 117,400 head of cattle were lost to animal predators in the U. S., totaling $39.6 million dollars. Coyotes accounted for 59% (69,350 head) of the total cattle and calves lost to predators. Dogs were the second leading cause for cattle and calves lost to predators, accounting for 19% (21,800 head). 1.2.2.3 Impacts to the Goat Industry During FY2000, producers were reimbursed from the ODA indemnity program for 32 goats lost to coyote predation in 12 counties of Ohio (Table 1.1). Coyotes and dogs were also the largest predators of goats in 3 major goat producing states (AZ, NM, and TX) accounting for 35.6% and 17.5% of predator losses, respectively (NASS 2000). The value of goats lost in those 3 states from all predators was $3.4 million. 1.2.2.4 Impacts to Other Livestock In Ohio, coyotes, foxes, and dogs have attacked, killed, or injured other livestock including: foals, range raised fowl and poultry, and hogs (Table 1.1). From 1991-2000, 835 depredation claims have been paid for the above-mentioned livestock lost to coyotes. During FY2000, producers were reimbursed from the ODA indemnity program for 134 "other" livestock lost to coyote predation in 18 counties of Ohio (Table 1.1). The frequency of these occurrences has been low; however, high numbers of animals (e.g., poultry and fowl) have been killed during each occurrence. Table 1.1.

Additionally, livestock producers do not have the appropriate certifications to use some methods to effectively stop predation. Livestock producers also have limited time to devote to developing expertise to remove livestock predators. Large livestock operations also have a need to efficiently use large acreage to cost effectively raise livestock for profit. The large number of animals raised by large livestock operations may prohibit effective use of some non-lethal methods (e.g., night penning) because of labor, time constraints, and disease concerns. Predator management can become very complex because of the numerous jurisdictions involved when assisting property owners throughout a state. Local, state, and Federal agencies should be involved or notified when implementing an IWDM program, and restrictions by those agencies must be incorporated into the IWDM program. Additionally, threatened and endangered species must be considered when implementing any IWDM program. Some IWDM methods can only be implemented by the WS program, as legal restrictions prevent livestock producers from using some tools (e.g., M-44's and Livestock Protection Collars) in Ohio. At this time the M-44 and Livestock Protection Collar are not registered by the ODA for use in the State of Ohio, but are considered as part of the IWDM plan throughout this EA. 1.2.4 The Ohio Cooperative Livestock Protection Program The Ohio Cooperative Livestock Protection Program (OCLPP) was established in January 1999 by leading livestock industry organizations concerned about the future of managing livestock losses due to predation in the State of Ohio. This committee includes: the Ohio Sheep Improvement Association, Ohio Cattleman's Association, Ohio Pork Producers Association, Ohio Poultry Association, Ohio Poultry Breeders Association, Ohio County Dog Wardens Association, Ohio County Commissioner's Association, Ohio Farm Bureau Federation, Ohio Livestock Coalition, and 5 producers. Ex-officio members of this committee include: the ODA, DOW, The Ohio State University Extension, and WS. The mission statement of this committee is "To protect livestock from wildlife damage and enhance producer profitability and viability with an effective, cooperative, interagency and industry integrated wildlife control and education program." Objectives of the OCLPP include: Y Y Y Y Y Y Y 1.3 Identify and utilize existing and new methods for control Pursue registration of the Livestock Protection Collar in Ohio Provide technical assistance and training to producers Increase producer and agency involvement Increase communication between all parties Increase formal training to cooperating agencies Coyote population management OHIO WILDLIFE SERVICES OBJECTIVES The need to manage predator impacts on livestock and poultry in Ohio was used by WS to define the objectives for the WS program in Ohio: Y Y Y 1.4 Respond to 100% of the requests for assistance with the appropriate action (technical assistance or direct control) as determined by Ohio WS personnel, applying the WS Decision Model (Slate et al. 1992). Reduce coyote, fox, dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore predation on livestock and poultry in Ohio to the greatest extent possible on properties where WS assistance is requested. Maintain the lethal take of non-target species to a minimum. RELATIONSHIP OF THIS ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS 1.4.1 ADC Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement WS has issued a FEIS on the national APHIS/WS program (USDA 1997a). This EA is tiered to the FEIS. Pertinent information available in the FEIS has been incorporated by reference into this EA. 1.5 DECISION TO BE MADE Based on the scope of this EA, the decisions to be made are: Y Should the Ohio WS program assist livestock producers with losses from predators in Ohio? Y If not, how should WS fulfill its legislative responsibilities for managing predation on livestock in Ohio? Y Would implementing an assistance program by WS for Ohio livestock producers experiencing predator losses have any significant impacts requiring preparation of an EIS? 1.6 RELATIONSHIP OF AGENCIES DURING PREPARATION OF THIS EA Based on agency relationships, MOU's and legislative authorities, the Ohio WS program is the lead agency for this EA, and therefore, responsible for the scope, contents and decisions made. The ODA and DOW contributed input throughout the EA preparation to ensure an interdisciplinary approach in compliance with NEPA, and agency mandates, policies, and regulations. 1.7 SCOPE OF THIS ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS 1.7.1 Actions Analyzed This EA evaluates coyote, red fox, feral dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore damage management by WS to protect livestock on private land or public facilities within the State of Ohio wherever such management is requested to the Ohio WS program. 1.7.2 American Indian Lands and Tribes Currently WS does not have any MOU's or signed agreements with any American Indian tribe in Ohio. If WS enters into an agreement with a tribe for predator damage management, this EA would be reviewed and supplemented if appropriate to insure compliance with NEPA. 1.7.3 Period for Which this EA is Valid This EA will remain valid until WS determines that new needs for action or new alternatives having different environmental effects must be analyzed. At that time, this analysis and document will be reviewed and revised as necessary. This EA will be reviewed each year to ensure that it is complete and still appropriate to the scope of WS activities. 1.7.4 Site Specificity This EA analyzes potential impacts of the Ohio WS program activities that will occur or could occur on private property sites or at public facilities within the State of Ohio. Because livestock production occurs throughout Ohio and coyotes are found in every county in the State of Ohio (C. Dwyer, Ohio Division of Wildlife, Oak Harbor, Ohio, personal communication), it is conceivable that WS direct control activities could occur anywhere in the State. Thus, this EA analyzes the potential impacts of such efforts wherever and whenever they may occur in the State of Ohio and this EA emphasizes significant issues as they relate to specific areas whenever possible. However, the substantive issues that pertain to the various types of coyote, red fox, feral dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore predation on livestock and resulting management are the same, for the most part, wherever they occur, and are treated as such. The substantive issues analyzed in this EA were: effects on target (coyote and red fox) species populations; effects on dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores; effects on non-target wildlife populations, including threatened and endangered (T&E) species; effects on human health and safety; humaneness of control methods used by WS; and effects on aesthetic values of target and non-target species. The standard WS Decision Model (Slate et al. 1992) and WS Directive 2.105 is the routine thought process that is the site-specific procedure for determining methods and strategies to use or recommend for individual actions conducted by WS in the State of Ohio (See USDA 1997a, Chapter 2 and Appendix N for a more complete description of the WS Decision Model and examples of its application). Decisions made using this thought process will be in accordance with any mitigation measures and SOP's described herein and adopted or established as part of the decision. 1.7.5 Public Involvement/Notification As part of this process, and as required by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and APHIS-NEPA implementing regulations, this document and its Decision are being made available to the public through "Notices of Availability" (NOA) published in local media and through direct mailings of NOA to parties that have specifically requested to be notified. New issues or alternatives raised after publication of public notices will be fully considered to determine whether the EA and its Decision should be revisited and, if appropriate, revised. 1.8 AUTHORITY AND COMPLIANCE 1.8.1 Authority of Federal and State Agencies for Coyote, Red Fox, Feral Dog, Wolf-hybrid, and Exotic Carnivore Livestock Damage Management in the State of Ohio See Chapter 1 of USDA (1997a) for a complete discussion of Federal laws pertaining to WS. 1.8.1.1 Wildlife Services Legislative Mandate The USDA is directed by law to protect American agriculture and other resources from damage associated with wildlife. The primary statutory authority for the Wildlife Services program is the Animal Damage Control Act of 1931 (7 U.S.C. 426-426c; 46 Stat. 1468), as amended in the Fiscal Year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations Bill, which provides that: "The Secretary of Agriculture may conduct a program of wildlife services with respect to injurious animal species and take any action the Secretary considers necessary in conducting the program. The Secretary shall administer the program in a manner consistent with all of the wildlife services authorities in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001." Since 1931, with the changes in societal values, WS policies and programs place greater emphasis on the part of the Act discussing "bringing (damage) under control," rather than "eradication" and "suppression" of wildlife populations. In 1988, Congress strengthened the legislative mandate of WS with the Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This Act states, in part: "That hereafter, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized, except for urban rodent control, to conduct activities and to enter into agreements with States, local jurisdictions, individuals, and public and private agencies, organizations, and institutions in the control of nuisance mammals and birds and those mammal and bird species that are reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, and to deposit any money collected under any such agreement into the appropriation accounts that incur the costs to be available immediately and to remain available until expended for Animal Damage Control activities." 1.8.1.2 U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service Legislative Mandate The USFWS authority for action is based on the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (as amended), which implements treaties with the United States, Great Britain (for Canada), the United Mexican States, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Section 3 of this Act authorized the Secretary of Agriculture: "From time to time, having due regard to the zones of temperature and distribution, abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of migratory flight of such birds, to determine when, to what extent, if at all, and by what means, it is compatible with the terms of the convention to allow hunting, taking, capture, killing, possession, sale, purchase, shipment, transportation, carriage, or export of any such bird, or any part, nest, or egg thereof, and to adopt suitable regulations permitting and governing the same, in accordance with such determinations, which regulations shall become effective when approved by the President." The authority of the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to the Migratory Bird Treaty was transferred to the Secretary of the Interior in 1939 pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. II. Section 4(f), 4 Fed. Reg. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433. CFR 50 Subchapter C - The National Wildlife Refuge System - Part 30 - Feral Animals - Subpart B-30.11 - Control of feral animals states: (a) Feral animals, including horses, burros, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, reindeer, dogs, and cats, without ownership that have reverted to the wild from a domestic state may be taken by authorized Federal or state personnel or by private persons operating under permit in accordance with applicable provisions of Federal or State law or regulation. 1.8.1.3 Mission of the Ohio Department of Agriculture The mission of the ODA is to provide regulatory protection to producers, agribusinesses and the consuming public; to promote Ohio agricultural products in domestic and international markets; and to educate the citizens of Ohio about the agricultural industry. The Division of Animal Industry is charged with protecting and promoting the health of Ohio's livestock and poultry industries. The ODA's Animal Damage Control program works with Ohio's livestock farmers to develop control methods for reducing the number of livestock losses due to coyotes. The ODA currently has a MOU with WS which establishes a cooperative relationship between WS and the ODA, outlines responsibilities, and sets forth annual objectives and goals of each agency for resolving wildlife damage management conflicts in Ohio. 1.8.1.4 Mission of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources The Mission of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) is to ensure a balance between the wise use and protection of Ohio's natural resources for the benefit of all. The ODNR was created by the Ohio Legislature in 1949 and charged with the responsibility of "formulating and putting into execution a long term comprehensive plan and program for the development and wise use of the natural resources of the state, to the end that the health, happiness and wholesome enjoyment of life of the people of Ohio may be further encouraged...." On the basis of biological data, the DOW issues regulations that supplement long-term statutes to protect wildlife and to provide the public with opportunities to benefit from wildlife for recreational, scientific, and other purposes. The ODNR has four fundamental mission components: 1) Resource management by sustained productivity of Ohio's renewable natural resources, promoting the wise use of nonrenewable natural resources, and protecting Ohio's invaluable threatened and endangered natural resources. 2) Economic development through job creation/expansion/retention, stimulating local economies, developing industry and tourism opportunities, and supporting the present and future economic health of the state. 3) Recreation by providing leisure services and recreation opportunities for the public at all levels. 4) Health and safety through fair and consistent law enforcement participating in regulatory matters and identifying and responding to environmental hazards. The ODNR currently has a MOU with WS. This document establishes a cooperative relationship between WS and ODNR, outlines responsibilities, and sets forth annual objectives and goals of each agency for resolving wildlife damage management conflicts in Ohio. 1.8.2 Compliance with Other Federal Laws Several other Federal laws authorize, regulate, or otherwise affect WS wildlife damage management. WS complies with these laws, and consults and cooperates with other agencies as appropriate. 1.8.2.1 National Environmental Policy Act WS prepares analyses of the environmental impacts of program activities to meet procedural requirements of this law. This EA meets the NEPA requirement for the proposed action in Ohio. When WS operational assistance is requested by another Federal agency, NEPA compliance is the responsibility of the other Federal agency. However, WS could agree to complete NEPA documentation at the request of the other Federal agency. 1.8.2.2 Endangered Species Act It is Federal policy, under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), that all Federal agencies shall seek to conserve T&E species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of the Act (Sec.2(c)) (Appendices C and D list Federal and State listed T&E species in Ohio). WS conducts Section 7 consultations with the USFWS to use the expertise of the USFWS to ensure that "any action authorized, funded or carried out by such an agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species . . . Each agency shall use the best scientific and commercial data available" (Sec.7(a)(2)). WS obtained a Biological Opinion (BO) from the USFWS in 1992 describing potential effects on T&E species and prescribing reasonable and prudent measures for avoiding jeopardy (USDA 1997a, Appendix F). WS initiated an informal Section 7 consultation with the USFWS for the proposed coyote, red fox, feral dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore damage management program. 1.8.2.3 Migratory Bird Treaty Act The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) provides the USFWS regulatory authority to protect species of birds that migrate outside the United States. The law prohibits any "take" of the species, except as permitted by the USFWS or by Federal agencies within the scope of their authority. 1.8.2.4 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) requires the registration, classification, and regulation of all pesticides used in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for implementing and enforcing FIFRA. All chemical methods used or recommended by the WS program in Ohio are registered with, and regulated by, the EPA and ODA, Division of Plant Industry, Pesticide Regulation and are used by WS in compliance with labeling procedures and requirements. 1.8.2.5 National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as Amended, and The Native American Graves and Repatriation Act of 1990 The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800), requires Federal agencies to: 1) determine whether activities they propose constitute "undertakings" that can result in changes in the character or use of historic properties, 2) if so, to evaluate the effects of such undertakings on such historic resources and consult with the State Historic Preservation Office regarding the value and management of specific cultural, archaeological and historic resources, and 3) consult with appropriate American Indian Tribes to determine whether they have concerns for traditional cultural properties in areas of these Federal undertakings. WS actions on tribal lands are only conducted at the tribe's request and under signed agreement; thus, the tribes have control over any potential conflict with cultural resources on tribal properties. WS activities as described under the proposed action do not cause ground disturbances nor do they otherwise have the potential to significantly affect visual, audible, or atmospheric elements of historic properties and are thus not undertakings as defined by the NHPA. In those cases, the officials responsible for management of such properties would make the request and would have decision-making authority over the methods to be used. WS actions are not undertakings as defined by the NHPA because such actions do not have the potential to result in changes in the character or use of historic properties. The Native American Graves and Repatriation Act of 1990 provides for protection of American Indian burial sites, human remains, funerary objects and sacred objects, and establishes procedures for notifying Tribes of any new discoveries. In consideration of American Indian cultural and archeological interests, the Ohio WS program provided a Notice of Availability (NOA) of this EA to all the tribes in Ohio. A copy of this EA will be provided to any American Indian tribe in the State of Ohio that expresses a concern or interest in the proposed WS action and/or prior to any WS activity proposed to be conducted on tribal lands. 1.8.3 Compliance with Other State Laws 1.8.3.1 Claim for Value of Livestock Injured or Killed by Coyote This statute of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) (�955.51), also known as the Indemnity Program, reimburses owners for the loss of livestock or poultry due to coyote predation. It states that: A) Any owner of horses, sheep, cattle, swine, mules, goats, domestic rabbits, or domestic fowl or poultry that have an aggregate fair market value of ten dollars or more and that have been injured or killed by a coyote shall notify the dog warden within three days after the loss or injury has been discovered. The dog warden promptly shall investigate the loss or injury and shall determine whether or not the loss or injury was made by a coyote. If the dog warden finds that the loss or injury was not made by a coyote, the owner has no claim under sections 955.51 to 955.53 of the Revised Code. If the dog warden finds that the loss or injury was made by a coyote, he promptly shall notify the wildlife officer of that finding. The wildlife officer then shall confirm the finding, disaffirm it, or state that he is uncertain about the finding. If the wildlife officer affirms the finding of the dog warden or states that he is uncertain about that finding, the owner may proceed with his claim under sections 955.51 to 955.53 of the Revised Code, and the dog warden shall provide the owner with duplicate copies of the claim form provided for in section 955.53 of the Revised Code and assist him in filling it out. The owner shall set forth the kind, grade, quality, and what he has determined is the fair market value of the animals, fowl, or poultry, the nature and amount of the loss or injury, the place where the loss or injury occurred, and all other pertinent facts in the possession of the claimant. If the animals, fowl, or poultry die as a result of their injuries, their fair market value is the market value of uninjured animals, fowl, or poultry on the date of the death of the injured animals, fowl, or poultry. If the animals, fowl, or poultry do not die as a result of their injuries, their fair market value is their market value on the date on which they received their injuries. (B) If the dog warden finds all the statements that the owner made on the form to be correct and agrees with the owner as to the fair market value of the animals, fowl, or poultry, he promptly shall so certify and send both copies of the form, together with whatever other documents, testimony, or information he has received relating to the loss or injury, to the department of agriculture. (C) If the dog warden does not find all the statements to be correct or does not agree with the owner as to the fair market value, the owner may appeal to the department of agriculture for a determination of his claim. In that case the owner shall secure statements as to the nature and amount of the loss or injury from at least two witnesses who viewed the results of the killing or injury and who can testify about the results and shall submit both copies of the form to the department no later than twenty days after the loss or injury was discovered. The dog warden shall submit to the department whatever documents, testimony, and other information he has received relating to the loss or injury. The department shall receive any other information or testimony that will enable it to determine the fair market value of the animals, fowl, or poultry injured or killed. (D) If the animals, fowl, or poultry described in division (A) of this section are registered in any accepted association or registry, the owner or his employee or tenant shall submit with the claim form the registration papers showing the lines of breeding, age, and other relevant matters. If the animals are the offspring of registered stock and eligible for registration, the registration papers showing the breeding of the offspring shall be submitted. 1.8.3.2 Confinement or Restraint of Dog This law (ORC �955.22, Part C) states that "except when a dog is lawfully engaged in hunting and accompanied by the owner, keeper, harborer, or handler of the dog, no owner, keeper, or harborer of any dog shall fail at any time to do either of the following: 1) Keep the dog physically confined or restrained upon the premises of the owner, keeper, or harborer by a leash, tether, adequate fence, supervision, or secure enclosure to prevent escape; and 2) Keep the dog under the reasonable control of some person." 1.8.3.3 Dog may be Killed for Certain Acts; Owner Liable for Damages This law (ORC �955.28) states that "a dog that is chasing or approaching in a menacing fashion or apparent attitude of attack, that attempts to bite or otherwise endanger, or that kills or injures a person or a dog that chases, injures, or kills livestock, poultry, other domestic animal, that is the property of another person, except a cat or another dog, can be killed at the time of that chasing, approaching, attempt, killing, or injury. If, in attempting to kill such a dog, a person wounds it, he is not liable to prosecution under the penal laws which punish cruelty to animals." 1.8.3.4 Fishing and Trapping Districts; Seasons; Restrictions on Taking; Possession and Selling This regulation (ORC �1533.04, Part D) states that "no person shall take a wild bird or wild quadruped from its nest, house, den, or burrow, or with a spear hunt, pursue, injure, or kill any wild bird or wild quadruped except as otherwise stated in Chapters 1533 and 1531 of the Ohio Revised Code." 1.8.3.5 Predatory Game May be Taken by Licensee This regulation (ORC �1533.78) "authorizes the holder of a propagating license or his employees to take at any time any predatory bird or animal which is in the act of destroying propagated game birds, game quadrupeds or fur bearing animals on the land described in such holder's license." 1.8.3.6 Nuisance Wild Animal Regulations This regulation (OAC �1501:31-15-03, Part B8) states that "all wild animals trapped under the authority of the nuisance wild animal trapping permit shall be released outside the limits of any incorporated city or village. Animals shall not be released on public or private property without the permission of the landowner. Except raccoon (Procyon lotor), skunk (Mephitis mephitis), coyote, fox, or opossum (Didelphis virginiana) that is trapped or taken shall be euthanized, or released on site." 1.8.3.7 Hunting and Trapping Regulations for Furbearing Animals In the OAC �1301:31-15-09, regulations for take, harvest limits, seasons, equipment requirements, laws, and other limitations are defined. Part Y states that "it shall be lawful for persons to take coyotes without a fur taker permit. Provided further, any person hunting coyotes shall have a valid hunting license." 1.8.3.8 Seasons for Game Animals This regulation (OAC �1501:31-15-17, Part H) states "wild boar, coyotes or groundhogs (Marmota monax) may be hunted year-round." CHAPTER 2: ISSUES AND AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT INTRODUCTION Chapter 2 contains a discussion of the issues, including those that will receive detailed environmental impact analysis in Chapter 4 (Environmental Consequences), and those that were used to develop mitigation measures and/or SOP's, and the issues that will not be considered in detail, with rationale. Pertinent portions of the affected environment will be included in this chapter in the discussion of issues used to develop mitigation measures. Additional descriptions of affected environments will be incorporated into the discussion of the environmental impacts in Chapter 4. Issues are concerns of the public and/or professional communities about potential environmental problems that might occur from a proposed Federal action. Such issues must be considered in the NEPA decision process. Issues relating to the management of wildlife damage were raised during the scoping process in preparing the programmatic ADC FEIS (USDA 1997a) and were considered in the preparation of this EA. These issues are fully evaluated within the FEIS, which analyzed specific data relevant to the Ohio WS program. 2.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT The areas of the proposed action may include any property owner or manager who has suffered damages or losses of livestock or poultry from predators within the State of Ohio. Control areas may include Federal, state, county, city, private, or other lands, where WS assistance has been requested by a landowner or manager to control predator damage to livestock or poultry. The control areas may also include property in or adjacent to identified sites where predation activities could cause damage or losses to livestock. Predator damage control may be conducted when requested by a landowner or manager, and only on properties with a Cooperative Agreement with WS. 2.2 ISSUES ADDRESSED IN DETAIL IN CHAPTER 4 Potential environmental impacts of the Proposed Action and Alternatives in relation to the following issues are discussed in Chapter 4. The following issues have been identified as areas of concern requiring consideration in this EA. Y Y Y Y Y Y Effects on Target (Coyote and Red Fox) Species Populations Effects on Dogs, Wolf-hybrids, and Exotic Carnivores Effects on Non-target Wildlife Populations, including T&E Species Effects on Human Health and Safety Humaneness of Control Methods Used by WS Effects on the Aesthetic Values of Target and Non-target Species Effects on Target (Coyote and Red Fox) Species Populations 2.2.1 Some persons and groups are concerned that the proposed action or any of the alternatives would result in the loss of local coyote and red fox populations or could have a cumulative adverse impact on regional or statewide populations. Based upon anticipated work, no more than 100 red fox and 500 coyotes are likely to be killed by WS use of lethal control methods under the proposed action or any of the alternatives in any one year. The DOW, Furbearer Biologist, was consulted in regards to any potential or suspected adverse that would result from WS proposed action. It was determined by the DOW that WS proposed any of the alternatives would not significantly impact coyote or red fox populations in the State (Appendix E). Additionally, the affect of the proposed action on those populations would only localized and would not adversely affect adjacent predator populations. impacts action or of Ohio be 2.2.2 Effects on Dogs, Wolf-hybrids, and Exotic Carnivores A common concern among members of the public and wildlife professionals, including WS personnel, is the impact of damage control methods and activities on dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores. Feral, abandoned, and liberated dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores are considered ownerless, living in a semi-wild or wild state, and without the care of an owner. The ownership of dogs as pets and hunting companions has a many feral and unwanted dogs in Ohio, local government and of dogs annually (Table 2.1). Some dogs are feral, others are have been liberated. WS SOP's include measures intended to species populations, including pet dogs and hunting dogs, and long tradition in Ohio. Since there are humane societies must euthanize thousands abandoned, and some such as wolf-hybrids mitigate or reduce the effects on non-target are presented in Chapter 3. Table 2.1. Feral and unwanted dogs euthanized by County Dog Wardens, humane societies, and Municipal animal control officers in Ohio as reported by The Ohio State University, College of Veterinary Medicine. 1996 Number of dogs euthanized 128,637 1997 122,270 1998 110,289 1999 125,205 Livestock producers and dog owners are very sensitive to the issue of dogs killing livestock because of the brutal means in which dogs kill or injure livestock, the attachment pet owners place on dogs, monetary losses incurred by livestock producers from dog damage, the difficulty some pet owners have in accepting responsibility for actions of their dogs, and the legal responsibility and liability dog owners bear for controlling their animals. Special efforts are made to avoid harming dogs not involved in livestock depredation. Some dogs occasionally kill or injure livestock, but rarely will dogs feed upon livestock. It is not uncommon for dogs to kill or injure many livestock in a short period of time. Where dogs are killing or injuring livestock, lethal or non-lethal control methods may be implemented by livestock producers, local animal control officers, WS, and others to protect livestock. The public is concerned that some dogs involved in killing or injuring livestock may be killed. Section 955.28 of the ORC states that dogs may be killed for injuring or killing livestock, poultry, or other domestic animals and the owner of that dog is responsible for damages. Moreover, the public is concerned innocent dogs may be inadvertently killed by some control methods. Pet dogs and dogs used for legal hunting are believed by some people to be especially at risk. However, the ORC (�955.22, Part C) states "Except when a dog is lawfully engaged in hunting and accompanied by the owner, keeper, harborer, or handler of the dog, no owner, keeper, or harborer of any dog shall fail at any time to do either of the following: 1) Keep the dog physically confined or restrained upon the premises of the owner, keeper, or harborer by a leash, tether, adequate fence, supervision, or secure enclosure to prevent escape; or 2) Keep the dog under the reasonable control of some person." Therefore, since WS activities will be communicated to the property owner and adjoining landowners, and hunters which are pursuing game on those properties must have permission from the landowners, it is unlikely that WS activities will impact pet dogs and hunting dogs of law-abiding citizens. WS examined the likelihood for hunting dogs that may be exposed to control methods resulting in unintentional death (Table 2.2). This examination also considered hunting seasons when hunting dogs are afield (Table 2.3). A review of all control methods (described in detail in Appendix B) identified M-44, Livestock Protection Collar (LPC) and guard animals as methods which may result in the unintentional death of a hunting dog or free-ranging pet. If the M-44 and LPC became legal in Ohio, the M-44 device and LPC would be implemented by WS under strict guidelines (see SOP's in Chapter 3) and would only be used on private property within a fenced area. In addition, M-44's would not be set from 19 August - 1 March which coincides with hunting seasons in which dogs may be used in Ohio. Guard animals may be recommended by WS, but implementation would be the landowner's responsibility. Based on the examination of the likelihood of hunting dogs to be in a fenced area and greater than 1/4 mile from the hunter, only dogs used for hunting fox or raccoon would likely be at risk to LPC's (Table 2.2). Hunters are required by state law to have written permission to hunt on private land (ORC �1533.18). Therefore, with the exception of fox hunting (where dogs may be more than one mile from the hunter with chases crossing multiple properties), hunters should have permission to hunt by private landowners where their dogs are likely to chase game animals. The LPC is designed to target those predators which are in the act of killing livestock; therefore, if a dog was in a fenced pasture where LPC's were on livestock that dog would have to bite the necks of those livestock where the LPC was located. However, because livestock producers may legally kill a dog for chasing, injuring, or killing livestock (ORC �955.28), it is the dog owners responsibility to avoid these situations. Based on this analysis, SOP's and state policies were developed (see SOP's in Chapter 3). Table 2.2. Likelihood of a hunting dog being in an extended chase and in a fenced area where LPC's may be used.

WS mitigation and SOP's are designed to reduce the effects on non-target species populations and are presented in Chapter 3. To reduce the risks of adverse impacts to non-target species, WS would select damage management methods that are as target species-specific as possible or would apply such methods in ways to reduce the likelihood of capturing non-target species. Before initiating control techniques, WS would select locations which are extensively used by the target species and use baits or lures which are preferred by the target species. Special efforts are made to avoid jeopardizing T&E Species through biological evaluations of the potential effects and the establishment of special restrictions or mitigation measures. WS has consulted with the USFWS under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) concerning potential impacts of WS IWDM methods on T&E species and has obtained a BO (USDI 1992). For the full context of the BO, see Appendix F of the ADC FEIS (USDA 1997a, Appendix F). WS is also in the process of reinitiating Section 7 consultation at the National level to assure that potential effects on T&E species have been adequately addressed. The USFWS's and DOW list of Federal and State T&E species for Ohio (Appendices C and D) were reviewed to determine whether any T&E species might be affected by the proposed action. WS, along with the USFWS (Appendix F), has determined that the proposed WS predator damage management program would not adversely impact Federally or State listed T&E species in the state of Ohio. In contrast to adverse impacts on non-target animals from direct take, some species may actually benefit from WS' methods. Coyotes, dogs, and red foxes are opportunistic predators and may feed on many bird and mammal species. Some examples include: coyotes killing fawn and adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) which some people enjoy watching, photographing, and legally hunting. Red fox eat eggs and fledglings of quail, wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), and ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) which some people enjoy viewing, feeding, or legally hunting. In contrast, others may argue that coyotes prey on deer which may help reduce the number of deer-vehicle collisions and crop damage in an area. 2.2.4 Effects on Human Health and Safety A common concern among the public is whether the proposed action or any of the alternatives pose an increased threat to human health and safety. Specifically, there is concern that the lethal methods of predator removal (i.e., chemicals, firearms) may be hazardous to people. A formal risk assessment of WS operational management methods found that risks to human safety were low (USDA 1997a, Appendix P). WS SOP's include measures intended to mitigate or reduce the effects on human health and safety and are presented in Chapter 3. 2.2.4.1 Safety and Efficacy of Chemical Control Methods Members of the public have expressed concerns that chemical control methods should not be used because of potential adverse effects on people from direct exposure to chemical toxicants or from animals that have died as a result of toxicants. Under the alternatives proposed in this EA, the primary toxicants proposed for use as chemical control methods by WS would be sodium cyanide (M-44) and sodium fluoroacetate (Livestock Protection Collar). A less commonly used toxicant proposed for use by WS would be sodium nitrate (Large Gas Cartridge). Sodium cyanide, sodium fluoroacetate, and sodium nitrate use is regulated by the EPA through FIFRA and by WS Directives. At this time, these above-mentioned toxicants are not registered for use in Ohio, but are included in the anyalsis of this EA for potential use in predator damage management when and if they become available for future use in Ohio. The use of sodium cyanide, sodium fluoroacetate, and sodium nitrate for mammalian predator damage management poses negligible risk when used according to directives, policies, laws, and label directions (USDA 1997a, Appendix P). According to the EPA, Poison Control Center, Toxic Exposure Surveillance System for 1993 - 1996, there were over 400,000 recorded human exposures to all sorts of animal toxicants; however, there were no recorded M-44 human exposures (e-mail from J. Shivik to M. Lowney, USDA, Wildlife Services, Moseley, Virginia, February 17, 1999). M-44's and coyote getters have been used for more than 50 years by WS without any employee fatalities. There was one human fatality from the predicidal use of sodium cyanide by a non-WS employee using a coyote getter (Letter from D. Gretz to WS State Directors, Western Region, November 27, 1989). WS SOP's include measures intended to mitigate or reduce the effects on human health and safety and are presented in Chapter 3. WS personnel who apply pesticides are certified restricted use pesticide applicators and apply pesticides according to label instructions. If the M-44 and LPC were registered for use in Ohio, certification for use of these devices would be obtained after passing written tests. 2.2.4.2 Safety and Efficacy of Non-chemical Control Methods There may be concern that WS use of firearms, traps, and snares could cause injuries to people. WS personnel may occasionally use rifles and shotguns to remove coyotes, foxes, feral dogs, wolf-hybrids, or exotic carnivores that are preying upon or attempting to prey upon livestock. Handguns may be used to humanely euthanize trapped or snared animals. WS personnel use special restraining traps and snares to humanely capture coyotes, foxes, feral dogs, wolf-hybrids, or exotic carnivores. Firearm use in wildlife damage management can be a publicly sensitive issue. Safety issues related to the misuse of firearms and the potential human hazards associated with firearms use are concerns both to the public and WS. To ensure safe use and awareness, WS employees who use firearms to conduct official duties are required to attend an approved firearms safety and use training program within 3 months of their appointment and a refresher course every 3 years afterwards (WS Directive 2.615). WS employees who carry and use firearms as a condition of employment, are required to sign a form certifying that they meet the criteria as stated in the Lautenberg Amendment which prohibits firearm possession by anyone who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Additionally, USDA runs thorough background checks on all new employees entering the agency and the Ohio WS program conducts annual firearms training for all personnel. The use of restraining traps such as foothold traps or snares is a sensitive issue because of the lack of understanding and experience by the public in using these devices. Some people believe they could be captured and restrained by these traps. Some people believe these traps indiscriminately and automatically capture people who may unknowingly approach locations where these traps or snares are set. To mitigate some of these concerns, WS personnel meet with livestock producers and their adjacent landowners to explain and demonstrate the use of traps and snares to alleviate anxiety some may have. WS also is assisting with the development of Best Management Practices (BMP's) for improving traps and trapping programs in the U.S. These BMP's evalute the animal welfare and efficiency of various traps for species which can be legally harvested in North America. 2.2.5 Humaneness of Control Methods Used by WS The issue of humaneness, as it relates to the killing or capturing of wildlife is an important, but very complex concept that can be interpreted in a variety of ways. Schmidt (1989) indicated that vertebrate pest damage management for societal benefits could be compatible with animal welfare concerns, if " . . . the reduction of pain, suffering, and unnecessary death is incorporated in the decision making process." Suffering is described as a " . . . distress." However, suffering " suffering . . . " (AVMA 2000). could be made for " . . . little or shooting. highly unpleasant emotional response usually associated with pain and . . . can occur without pain . . . ," and " . . . pain can occur without Because suffering carries with it the implication of a time frame, a case no suffering where death comes immediately . . . " (CDFG 1991), such as Defining pain as a component in humaneness of WS methods appears to be a greater challenge than that of suffering as pain obviously occurs in animals. Altered physiology and behavior can be indicators of pain, and identifying the causes that elicit pain responses in humans would " . . . probably be causes for pain in other animals . . . " (AVMA 2000). However, pain experienced by individual animals probably ranges from little or no pain to significant pain (CDFG 1991). Pain and suffering, as it relates to WS damage management methods, has both a professional and lay point of arbitration. Wildlife managers and the public would be better served to recognize the complexity of defining suffering, since " . . . neither medical or veterinary curricula explicitly address suffering or its relief" (CDFG 1991). Therefore, humaneness, in part, appears to be a person's perception of harm or pain inflicted on an animal, and people may perceive the humaneness of an action differently. The challenge in coping with this issue is how to achieve the least amount of animal suffering within the constraints imposed by current technology and funding. Animal welfare organizations are concerned that some methods used to manage wildlife damage expose animals to unnecessary pain and suffering. Research suggests that with some methods, such as restraint in foothold traps, changes in the blood chemistry of trapped animals indicate "stress." Blood measurements indicated similar changes in foxes that had been chased by dogs for about five minutes as those restrained in traps (USDA 1997a). However, such research has not yet progressed to the development of objective, quantitative measurements of pain or stress for use in evaluating humaneness. WS is very concerned about animal welfare and where possible, more humane methods are used to capture or kill animals. WS has been funding research to develop Best Management Practices for the use of restraining traps since 1997 and funding trap research for decades (Phillips and Mullis 1996, and Engeman et al. 1997). This would include the use of foothold traps and snares. Traps and snares used by WS embrace many innovations reported in the scientific literature. Coyote size traps must have smooth rounded offset jaws or padded jaws, and pan-tension devices (WS Directive 4.450). There is concern about captured animals remaining in traps and either chewing their feet or dying. Recent studies have found that coyotes rarely chewed their feet (< 1% of captures) and no animals died in coyote traps from the trap (BMP workshop, unpublished data). To reduce the chance for injury, restraining traps (e.g., foothold traps) and snares are checked daily by WS personnel or by cooperators. The decision making process involves tradeoffs between managing damage and the aspect of humaneness. The challenge in coping with this issue is how to achieve the least amount of animal suffering with the constraints imposed by current technology, yet provide sufficient damage management to resolve problems. WS has improved the selectivity of management devices through research and development such as pan tension devices for traps and breakaway snares. Research is continuing to bring new findings and products into practical use. Until such time as new findings and products are found to be practical, a certain amount of alleged animal suffering will occur if management objectives are to be met in those situations where non-lethal control methods are not practical or effective. WS personnel in Ohio are experienced and professional in their use of management methods. Consequently, control methods are implemented in the most humane manner possible under the constraints of current technology. Mitigation measures and SOP's used to maximize humaneness are listed in Chapter 3. 2.2.6 Effects on the Aesthetic Values of Target and Non-target Species The human attraction to animals has been well documented throughout history and started when humans began domesticating animals. The American public shares a similar bond with animals and/or wildlife in general, and today a large percentage of American households have pets. However, some people may consider individual wild animals and birds as "pets" or exhibit affection toward these animals, especially people who enjoy coming in contact with wildlife. Therefore, the public reaction is variable and mixed to wildlife damage management because there are numerous philosophical, aesthetic, and personal attitudes, values, and opinions about the best ways to manage conflicts/problems between humans and wildlife. There is some concern that the proposed action or the alternatives would result in the loss of aesthetic benefits to the public, resource owners, or neighboring residents. Wildlife generally is regarded as providing economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits (Decker and Goff 1987), and the mere knowledge that wildlife exists is a positive benefit to many people. Aesthetics is the philosophy dealing with the nature of beauty, or the appreciation of beauty. Therefore, aesthetics is truly subjective in nature, dependent on what an observer regards as beautiful. Wildlife populations provide a wide range of social and economic benefits (Decker and Goff 1987). These include direct benefits related to consumptive and non-consumptive use (e.g., wildlife-related recreation, observation, harvest, sale, etc.), indirect benefits derived from vicarious wildlife related experiences (e.g., reading, television viewing, etc.), and the personal enjoyment of knowing wildlife exists and contributes to the stability of natural ecosystems (e.g., ecological, existence, bequest values) (Bishop 1987). Direct benefits are derived from a user's personal relationship to animals and may take the form of direct consumptive use (using parts of, or the entire animal) or non-consumptive use (viewing the animal in nature or in a zoo, photography) (Decker and Goff 1987). Indirect benefits or indirect exercised values arise without the user being in direct contact with the animal and come from experiences such as looking at photographs and films of wildlife, reading about wildlife, or benefiting from activities or contributions of animals such as their use in research (Decker and Goff 1987). Indirect benefits come in two forms: bequest and pure existence (Decker and Goff 1987). Bequest is providing for future generations and pure existence is merely knowledge that the animals exist (Decker and Goff 1987). Some people have an idealistic view of wildlife and believe that all wildlife should be captured and relocated to another area to alleviate damage or threats to protected resources. Those directly affected by the problems caused by wildlife usually support removal. Whereas, individuals not directly affected by wildlife damage may be supportive, neutral, or totally opposed to any removal of wildlife from specific locations or sites. Wildlife damage management practices are controversial in nature because they may affect each individual differently. WS goals are to assist resources owners in reducing damages while considering all possible non-lethal and lethal methods and employing those methods in a caring, humane, and professional manner. In addition, Ohio WS would only conduct predator damage management at the request of the affected property owner or resource manager. 2.2.6.1 Effects on Aesthetic Values of Coyote and Red Foxes to the General Public With the increase in urban sprawl, human encounters with wildlife are becoming more common. Many people enjoy feeding such animals and/or otherwise develop emotional attitudes toward wildlife that results in aesthetic enjoyment. In addition, some people consider individual wild animals as "pets," or exhibit affection toward these animals. WS Proposed Action will have minimal effects on animals which provide aesthetic enjoyment to the general public. However, it is possible that WS may occasionally remove a predator that is involved with livestock predation and also provides aesthetic enjoyment. Dispersal of young coyotes or red foxes in the fall and late winter from other areas would likely replace animals removed during a damage management action; thus, providing continued aesthetic enjoyment to the general public. Similarly, predators located in public areas (e.g., State Park or Wildlife Area) where the general public may enjoy (i.e., viewing, photography, feeding, etc.) the presence of predators, should not be concerned that WS Proposed Actions would have an adverse effect on these predators. It is possible that WS actions may remove predators on a farm in close proximity to a public area if that livestock producer is experiencing predator damage; however, those occurrences are expected to be rare. 2.2.6.2 Effects on Aesthetic Values of Coyotes and Red Foxes to Livestock Owners and Hunters Livestock and poultry producers who have experienced losses by coyotes or foxes feel these predators have little to no positive value. Some hunters feel coyotes and foxes compete with them for the same game animals they are pursuing. Other landowners who benefit from leasing land to hunters may feel coyotes and foxes are depriving them of monetary gain because coyotes and foxes are eating game animals which hunters would be willing to lease land to hunt. These individuals may feel the environment would be better off if no coyotes and fewer red fox existed in Ohio. In these instances coyotes and red fox have low or no aesthetic value to these stakeholders. Predator hunters and trappers may feel that WS actions will compete with them for resources. Although WS may remove coyotes and foxes in areas where hunters or trappers pursue predators, WS actions will typically be on privately owned property during the non-hunting/trapping seasons when pelts are not prime for sale. Instead of competing with hunters and trappers, WS will recommend hunting and trapping to producers as additional predator control methods. ISSUES USED TO DEVELOP MITIGATION 2.3.1 Environmental Justice and Executive Order 12898 - "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Population" 2.3 Environmental Justice (EJ) is a movement promoting the fair treatment of all races, income, and culture with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment implies that no person or group of people should endure a disproportionate share of the negative environmental impacts resulting either directly or indirectly from the activities conducted to execute this country's domestic and foreign policies or programs. EJ has been defined as the pursuit of equal justice and equal protection under the law for all environmental statutes and regulations without discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. (The EJ movement is also known as Environmental Equity - which is the equal treatment of all individuals, groups or communities regardless of race, ethnicity, or economic status, from environmental hazards). EJ is a priority both within the USDA/APHIS and WS. Executive Order 12898 requires Federal agencies to make EJ part of their mission, and to identify and address disproportionately high adverse human health and environmental effects of Federal programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income persons or populations. A critical goal of Executive Order 12898 is to improve the scientific basis for decision-making by conducting assessments that identify and prioritize environmental health risks and procedures for risk reduction. WS developed a strategy that: 1) identifies major programs and areas of emphasis to meet the intent of the Executive Order, 2) minimize any adverse effects on the human health and environment of minorities and low-income persons or populations, and 3) carries out the APHIS mission. To that end, APHIS operates according to the following principles: 1) promote outreach and partnerships with all stakeholders, 2) identify the impacts of APHIS activities on minority and low-income populations, 3) streamline government, 4) improve the day-to-day operations, and 5) foster nondiscrimination in APHIS programs. In addition, APHIS plans to implement Executive Order 12898 through its compliance with the provisions of NEPA. All WS activities are evaluated for their impact on the human environment and compliance with Executive Order 12898 to insure EJ. WS personnel use wildlife damage management methods as selectively and environmentally conscientiously as possible. All chemicals used by WS are regulated by the EPA through FIFRA; by the FDA; the ODA, Division of Plant Industry, Pesticide Regulation; by MOU's with Federal land management agencies, and program directives. Based on a thorough risk assessment, APHIS concluded that when WS program chemicals are used following label directions, they are selective to target individuals or populations and such use has negligible impacts on the environment (USDA 1997a, Appendix P). The WS operational program, discussed in this document, properly disposes of any excess solid or hazardous waste. It is not anticipated that the proposed action would result in any adverse or disproportionate environmental impacts to minority or low-income persons or populations. In contrast, WS activities may actually benefit those with low-income or those whose sole source of income is livestock production. Assistance by WS with predation to livestock may allow those individuals relying on livestock production for income to continue their practices. 2.3.2 Protection of Children from Environmental Health and Safety Risks (Executive Order 13045) WS prioritizes the identification and assessment of environmental health and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children. Children may suffer disproportionately from environmental health and safety risks for many reasons, including their physical and mental status. WS has concluded that the proposed management program would not create an environmental health or safety risks to children because the program would only make use of legally available and approved damage management methods applied where such methods are highly unlikely to adversely affect children. 2.4 ISSUES CONSIDERED BUT NOT IN DETAIL WITH RATIONALE 2.4.1 Legal Constraints on Implementation of Control WS is required to follow and adhere to all Federal and state regulations. The methods proposed for use in livestock protection/predator damage management are all permitted by Federal and state laws, or the appropriate exemptions/permits will be obtained. 2.4.2 Appropriateness of Preparing an EA (Instead of an EIS) for Such a Large Area Some individuals might question whether preparing an EA for an area as large as Ohio would meet the NEPA requirements for site specificity. Wildlife damage management falls within the category of Federal or other agency actions in which the exact timing or location of individual activities cannot usually be predicted well enough ahead of time to accurately describe such locations or times in an EA or EIS. The WS program is analogous to other agencies or entities with damage management missions such as fire and police departments, emergency cleanup organizations, insurance companies, etc. Although WS can predict some of the possible locations or types of situations and sites where some kinds of wildlife damage will occur, the program cannot predict the specific locations or times at which affected resource owners will determine a predation damage problem has become intolerable to the point that they request assistance from WS. Nor would WS be able to prevent such damage in all areas where it might occur without resorting to destruction of wild animal populations over broad areas at a much more intensive level than would be desired by most people, including WS and state agencies. Such broad scale population control would also be impractical, if not impossible, to achieve. If a determination is made through this EA that the proposed action would have a significant environmental impact, then an EIS would be prepared. In terms of considering cumulative impacts, one EA analyzing impacts for the entire State may provide a better analysis than multiple EA's covering smaller zones. 2.4.3 Cost Effectiveness of Predator Damage Management - Livestock Protection NEPA does not require preparation of a specific cost-benefit analysis, and consideration of this issue would not be essential to making a reasoned choice among the alternatives being considered. However, cost-effectiveness of WS activities was a common concern among many comments received from other EA's written by other WS offices during the public involvement process and therefore is included in this EA. Connolly (1981) examined the issue of cost effectiveness of Federal predator damage management programs and concluded that public policy decisions have been made to steer the program away from being as cost effective as possible. This is because of the elimination of damage management methods believed to be effective but less environmentally preferable, such as toxic baits. In addition, the increased costs of implementing the remaining available methods were to achieve other public benefits besides livestock protection and could be viewed as mitigation for the loss of effectiveness in reducing damage. USDA (1997a) stated that "Cost effectiveness is not, nor should it be, the primary goal of the WS program." Additional constraints, such as environmental protection, land management goals, and others, are considered whenever a request for assistance is received (USDA 1997a). These constraints increase the cost of the program while not necessarily increasing its effectiveness, yet they are considered a vital part of the WS program. A cost-benefit analysis is usually limited to quantifiable values and does not consider a number of values that would be difficult to measure. When sheep are repeatedly harassed by predators, for example, they become extremely alarmed and weary and do not disperse and feed normally. Therefore, they would not find the quality and quantity of feed that they would have if unstressed, resulting in lower lamb weights at the end of the grazing season. This is a form of predator damage, but it would be difficult to quantify. Jahnke et al. (1988) and Wagner (1988) discussed additional examples of indirect predator damage, including increased labor costs and producer efforts to find sheep scattered by predators and range damage related to the tighter herding required in response to the presence of predators. Cost-effectiveness of WS predator damage management can be assessed by looking at the difference between: 1) the value of actual losses with the program in place, plus the cost of the program, and 2) the value of what losses could reasonably be expected without the program in place. USDA (1997a) cites four studies where sheep losses to predators were documented with no damage management program in place (Table 2.4). Annual predation loss rates during these studies varied from 6.3-29.3% for lambs and 0 to 20.8% for adult sheep. The average rate of loss to predators was about 7% for sheep and 17% for lambs. It is reasonable to assume losses without damage management in place could be similar to those found in the studies examined in Table 2.4 in areas with historic coyote predation. Table 2.4. Annual predation loss rates for sheep and lambs in 5 studies in the United States. Annual loss rates Sheep Lambs Source Location Year Henne (1977) Munoz (1977) McAdoo and Klebenow (1978) Delorenza and Howard (1976) Montana Montana California New Mexico 1976 1975 1974/1975 1975/1976 N/A 0% 20.8% 16% 6.3% 12.1% 29.3% 24.4% Delorenza and Howard (1976) New Mexico 1976 0% 15.6% The Ohio WS program has not conducted predator damage management in the State of Ohio in recent years; therefore, data does not exist to create a cost-benefit analysis. At times, control operations may be constrained by cooperator monies and/or objectives and needs. However, the methods determined to be most effective in controlling predator damage and proven to be most cost effective will receive the greatest application. 2.4.4 Effects on Legal Hunting and Trapping Some people may be concerned that WS-conducted predator management activities would affect regulated hunting and trapping by reducing local wild canid populations and that lethal and non-lethal damage management methods may interfere with legal regulated hunting and trapping. WS annual take of coyotes and fox by lethal control methods would be very minimal compared to the annual take by licensed hunters in Ohio (See Section 4.1.1). WS activities may result in reduced coyote or fox densities on project area properties and on adjacent properties, hence slightly reducing the number of coyotes and fox that may otherwise be available to local licensed hunters. Coyote and fox densities on other properties outside the project area would likely not be effected, thus providing ample opportunities for hunters and trappers to harvest these animals. 2.4.5 Lethal Methods may Increase Predation and the Coyote Population through Compensatory Reproduction Mortality in coyote populations can range from 19%-100%, with 40%-60% mortality most common (USDI 1979). Several studies of coyote survival rates, which include calculations based on the age distribution of coyote populations, show typical annual survival rates of only 45% to 65% for adult coyotes. High mortality rates have also been shown in four telemetry studies involving 437 coyotes that were older than 5 months of age; 47% of the marked animals are known to have died (USDI 1979). Mortality rates of "unexploited" coyote populations were reported to be between 38%-56%. Thus, most natural coyote populations are not stable (USDI 1979). In studies where reported coyote mortality was investigated, only 14 of 326 recorded mortalities were due to WS activities (USDI 1979). Dispersal of "surplus" young coyotes is the main factor that keeps coyote populations distributed throughout their habitat (Knowlton 1972, Harrison et al. 1991, Harrison 1992). Such dispersal of subdominant animals removes surplus animals from higher density areas and repopulates areas where artificial reductions have occurred. Studies (Connolly et al. 1976, Gese and Grothe 1995, Gese 1999) which investigated the predatory behavior of coyotes, determined that the more dominant (alpha) animals (adult breeding pairs) were the ones that initiated and killed most of the prey items. Thus, it appears the above concern is unfounded because the removal of local territorial (dominant, breeding adult) coyotes actually removes the individuals that are most likely to kill livestock and generally results in the immigration of subdominant coyotes that are less likely to prey on livestock. Coyotes in areas of lower population densities may reproduce at an earlier age and have more offspring per litter; however, these same populations generally sustain higher mortality rates (Connolly and Longhurst 1975). Therefore, the overall population of the area does not change. The number of breeding coyotes does not substantially increase without exploitation and individual coyote territories produce one litter per year independent of the population being exploited or unexploited (Connolly and Longhurst 1975). Connolly and Longhurst (1975) demonstrated that coyote populations in exploited and unexploited populations do not increase at significantly different rates and that an area will only support a population to its carrying capacity. CHAPTER 3: ALTERNATIVES INTRODUCTION Alternatives were developed for consideration using the WS Decision Model (Slate et al. 1992) as described in Chapter 2 (pages 20-35), Appendix J (Methods of Control), Appendix N (Examples of WS Decision Model), and Appendix P (Risk Assessment of Wildlife Damage Control Methods Used by USDA, Wildlife Services Program) of the ADC FEIS (USDA 1997a). Chapter 3 of this EA contains a discussion of the project alternatives, including those that will receive detailed environmental impacts analysis in Chapter 4 (Environmental Consequences), alternatives considered but not analyzed in detail, with rationale, and mitigation measures and SOP's for wildlife damage management techniques. Pertinent portions of the affected environment will be included in this chapter in the discussion of issues used to develop mitigation measures. Evaluation of the affected environments will be addressed in more detail in Chapter 4. ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED IN DETAIL Alternative 1 - No Action, Technical Assistance Only - This alternative precludes any and all IWDM direct control activities by WS to protect livestock from predation in Ohio. Producers or any other entity directed at preventing or reducing predation of livestock could conduct IWDM direct control activities in the absence of WS involvement. However, if requested, affected producers would be provided with technical assistance information only. Alternative 2 - Non-lethal Control Only - This alternative would involve the use and recommendation of non-lethal management techniques only by WS. Alternative 3 - Non-lethal Control before Lethal Control - This alternative would not allow the use or recommendation of lethal control by WS until all available non-lethal methods had been applied and determined to be inadequate in each damage situation. Alternative 4 - Lethal Control Only - This alternative would involve the use and recommendation of lethal management techniques only by WS. Alternative 5 - Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (Proposed Action) - This alternative would incorporate an integrated approach to wildlife damage management using components of the wildlife damage management techniques and methods addressed in Alternatives 2-4 as deemed appropriate by WS and other participating entities. Alternative 6 - No Federal WS Predator Damage Management in Ohio - This alternative would result in no assistance from WS in reducing predator damage to livestock in Ohio. WS would not provide technical assistance or operational damage management services. 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE ALTERNATIVES 3.1.1 Alternative 1 - No Action, Technical Assistance Only This alternative precludes any and all IWDM direct control activities by WS to protect livestock from predation in Ohio. Producers or any other entity directed at preventing or reducing predation of livestock could conduct IWDM direct control activities in the absence of WS involvement. However, if requested, affected producers would be provided with technical assistance information only. 3.1.2 Alternative 2 - Non-lethal Control Only Under this alternative, only non-lethal direct control activities and recommendations would be provided by WS to resolve coyote, fox, feral dog, wolf-hybrid, or exotic carnivore predation on livestock. Requests for information regarding lethal management approaches would be referred to DOW, local animal control agencies, or private businesses or organizations. Individuals or agencies might choose to implement WS non-lethal recommendations, implement lethal methods or other methods not recommended by WS, contract for WS direct control services, use contractual services of private businesses, use volunteer services of private organizations, or take no action. In some cases, control methods employed by others could be contrary to the intended use or in excess of what is necessary. Persons receiving non-lethal assistance could still resort to lethal methods that were available. Lethal control methods which could be implemented by the public include: shooting, calling and shooting, snares, and trapping. M-44's and Livestock Protection Collars are not registered in the state of Ohio at this time. Therefore, use of these chemicals by private individuals and state and local government agency personnel would be illegal. Appendix B describes a number of non-lethal methods available for use by WS under this alternative. 3.1.3 Alternative 3 - Non-lethal Control before Lethal Control This alternative would require that all methods or techniques described in 3.1.2 be applied and determined to be inadequate in each damage situation prior to the implementation of any of the methods or techniques described in 3.1.4. This would be the case regardless of the severity or intensity of predation on livestock. 3.1.4 Alternative 4 - Lethal Control Only This alternative would allow the lethal removal of coyotes, foxes, feral dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores causing predation on livestock. Lethal control methods would be applied in all areas of control operations. Feral/free-ranging domestic dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores that were captured in restraining devices would be reported to the County Dog Warden. Coyotes and foxes would be euthanized on site in a humane manner utilizing American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) approved methods and WS SOP's. Euthanization would occur by either injection with a WS approved drug or shooting. Deceased animals would be buried or taken to a landfill, in accordance with WS policy and State Regulations. Unharmed and uninjured non-target animals that can be safely handled, would be released on site. Lethal methods of wildlife control are often very effective when used properly. Specific problem animals can be targeted and removed without negatively affecting the local population of a species (Bailey 1984). All control measures would be implemented in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local laws, and WS policy. Weather and environmental conditions permitting, all field equipment would be checked at least once each day. If daily checking is not possible, all control equipment would be removed from the site. Local population reduction of coyotes and foxes to reduce immediate predation losses and potential predation threats may be implemented by WS personnel with assistance from the participating land managers. Target individuals would be lethally removed using the methods and techniques listed in Appendix B. Technical assistance would still be provided to livestock producers to allow them to take predators by lethal methods. Requests for information regarding non-lethal management approaches would be referred to DOW, local animal control agencies, or private businesses or organizations. Individuals or agencies might choose to implement WS lethal recommendations, implement non-lethal methods or other methods not recommended by WS, contract for WS direct control services, use contractual services of private businesses, use volunteer services of private organizations, or take no action. In some cases, control methods employed by others could be contrary to the intended use or in excess of what is necessary. Not all of the methods listed in Appendix B as potentially available to WS would be legally available to all other agencies or individuals (e.g., M-44's and LPC's). 3.1.5 Alternative 5 - Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (Proposed Action) This alternative, the proposed action, would incorporate an IWDM program utilizing any legal techniques and methods, used singly or in combination, described in Alternatives 2-4 to meet requester needs for resolving predation on livestock and conflicts with coyotes, foxes, feral dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores. Cooperators requesting assistance would be provided with information regarding the use of effective non-lethal and lethal techniques. In many situations, the implementation of non-lethal methods are best implemented by livestock producers and would be the responsibility of the requester to implement. All management actions would comply with appropriate Federal, state, and local laws, and WS policy. 3.1.6 Alternative 6 - No Federal WS Predator Damage Management in Ohio This alternative would result in no assistance from WS in reducing predator damage to livestock in Ohio. WS would not provide technical assistance or operational damage management services. All requests for predator damage management would be referred to the DOW, local animal control agencies, or private businesses or organizations. Assistance may or may not be available from any of these entities. 3.2 STRATEGIES AND METHODOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO WS IN OHIO The strategies and methodologies described below include those that could be used or recommended under the Alternatives 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 described above, Alternative 6 would eliminate any assistance by WS. Alternative 1 would not allow WS to conduct direct control activities. Appendix B is a more thorough description of the methods that could be used or recommended by WS. 3.2.1 Integrated Wildlife Damage Management The most effective approach to resolving wildlife damage is to integrate the use of several methods simultaneously or sequentially. The philosophy behind IWDM is to implement the best combination of effective management methods in a cost-effective manner while minimizing the potentially harmful effects on humans, target and non-target species, and the environment. IWDM may incorporate cultural practices (e.g., animal husbandry), habitat modification (e.g., exclusion), animal behavior modification (e.g., harassment), removal of individual offending animals, local population reduction, or any combination of these and other effective methods, depending on the circumstances of the specific damage problem. WS considers the biology and behavior of the damaging species and other factors using the WS Decision Model (Slate et al 1992). The recommended strategy(ies) may include any combination of preventive and corrective actions that could be implemented by the requester, WS, or other agency personnel, as appropriate. Two strategies are available: 3.2.1.1 Preventive Damage Management Preventive damage management is applying wildlife damage management strategies before damage occurs, based on historical problems and data. All non-lethal methodologies, whether applied by WS or resource owners, are employed to prevent damage from occurring, and therefore, fall under this heading. When requested, WS personnel provide information and conduct demonstrations, or take action to prevent additional losses from recurring. For example, in areas where lamb or calf depredations have occurred historically, WS may provide information about livestock guarding animals, fencing or other husbandry techniques, or if requested, conduct coyote damage management before lambing or calving begins. The rationale for conducting preventive principle from holding controlled hunts been a historical problem. By reducing number of coyotes near a herd of sheep, damage management to reduce damage differs little in for deer or elk in areas where agricultural damage has the number of deer near agricultural fields, or the the likelihood of damage is reduced. Shelton and Klindt (1974) documented a strong correlation between coyote densities and levels of sheep loss in Texas, and Robel et al. (1981) found a similar correlation in Kansas. In southeastern Idaho, Stoddart and Griffiths (1986) documented an increase in lamb losses followed by a decrease in lamb losses as coyote populations rose and fell. Gantz (1990) concluded that late winter removal of territorial coyotes from mountain grazing allotments would reduce predation on sheep grazing on those allotments the following summer. 3.2.1.2 Corrective Damage Management Corrective damage management is applying wildlife damage management to stop or reduce current losses. As requested and appropriate, WS personnel provide information and conduct demonstrations, or take action to prevent additional losses from recurring. For example, in areas where verified and documented livestock depredations are occurring, WS may provide information about livestock guarding animals, fencing or husbandry techniques, or conduct operational damage management to stop the losses. The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) concluded that, according to available research, localized lethal damage management is effective in reducing coyote damage (GAO 1990). 3.2.2 The IWDM Strategies that WS Employs in Ohio 3.2.2.1 Technical Assistance Recommendations (implementation is the responsibility of the requester) "Technical assistance" as used herein is information, demonstrations, and advice on available and appropriate wildlife damage management methods. Technical assistance may require substantial effort by WS personnel in the decision making process, but the implementation of damage management actions is the responsibility of the requester. In some cases, WS provides supplies or materials that are of limited availability for non-WS entities to use. Technical assistance may be provided following a personal or telephone consultation, or during an on-site visit with the requester. Generally, several management strategies are described to the requester for short and long-term solutions to damage problems, these strategies are based on the level of risk, need, and the practicality of their application. Under APHIS' NEPA Implementing regulations and specific guidance for the WS program, WS technical assistance is categorically excluded from the need to prepare an EA or EIS. However, it is discussed in this EA because it is an important component of the IWDM approach to resolving livestock damage problems. 3.2.2.2 Direct Control Damage Management Assistance (assistance conducted or supervised by WS personnel) Direct control damage management assistance may be initiated when the problem cannot effectively be resolved through technical assistance alone, and when Agreements for Control or other comparable instruments provide for WS direct control damage management. The initial investigation defines the nature, history, extent of the problem, species or property directly and indirectly damaged, species responsible for the damage, and methods that would be available to resolve the problem. Professional skills of WS personnel are often required to effectively resolve problems, especially if restricted use pesticides are necessary, or if the problem is complex. 3.2.2.3 Educational Efforts in Ohio Education is an important element of WS program activities because wildlife damage management is about finding "balance" or coexistence between the needs of people and needs of wildlife. This is extremely challenging as nature has no balance, but rather, is in continual flux. In addition to the routine dissemination of recommendations and information to individuals or organizations sustaining damage, lectures and demonstrations are provided to producers, homeowners, state and county agents, and other interested groups. WS frequently cooperates with other agencies in education and public information efforts. Additionally, technical papers are presented at professional meetings and conferences so that WS personnel, other wildlife professionals, and the public are periodically updated on recent developments in damage management technology, laws and regulations, and agency policies. WS provides informational leaflets about identifying predation damage, biology and ecology of the predator(s) involved, specific methods and products most effective in reducing losses, and sources for supplies/products. 3.2.3 WS Decision Making Figure 3.1 Wildlife Services Decision Model Process WS personnel use a thought process for evaluating and responding to damage complaints that is depicted by the WS Decision Model described by Slate et al. (1992) (Figure 3.1). WS personnel are frequently contacted after requesters have tried or considered non-lethal methods and found them to be impractical, too costly, or inadequate for reducing damage to an acceptable level. WS personnel assess the problem, evaluate the appropriateness and availability (legal and administrative) of strategies and methods based on biological, economic and social considerations. Following this evaluation, the methods deemed to be practical for the situation are developed into a management strategy. After the management strategy has been implemented, monitoring is conducted and evaluation continues to assess the effectiveness of the strategy. If the strategy is effective, the need for further management is ended. In terms of the WS Decision Model (Slate et al. 1992), most damage management efforts consist of continuous feedback between receiving the request and monitoring the results of the damage management strategy. The Decision Model is not a documented process, but a mental problem-solving process common to most if not all professions. 3.2.4 Decision Making by Livestock Producers The WS program in Ohio follows the "Co-managerial approach" to solve wildlife damage or conflicts as described by Decker and Chase (1997). Within this management model, WS provides technical assistance regarding the biology and ecology of coyotes, foxes, feral dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores and effective, practical, and reasonable methods available to the producers to reduce predation on livestock. This includes non-lethal and lethal methods. Some technical assistance on alleviating damage caused by predators is available from the DOW, ODA, County Extension Agents, County Soil and Water Conservation Districts, county animal control, and private nuisance wildlife control agents. WS and other state and Federal wildlife or wildlife damage management agencies may facilitate discussions at local community meetings when resources are available. Livestock producers directly affected by predation have direct input into the resolution of such problems. Producers may implement management recommendations provided by WS or others, or may request management assistance from WS, other wildlife management agencies, local animal control agencies, or private businesses or organizations. Livestock producers decide which effective methods should be used to solve a livestock predation problem on their farm. These livestock producer decision makers include private property owners/managers, and public property managers. 3.3 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT NOT ANALYZED IN DETAIL WITH RATIONALE 3.3.1 Compensation for Wildlife Damage Losses The ODA Indemnity Program (ORC �955.51) currently reimburses livestock producers for losses due to coyote predation. Although this reimbursement provides producers monetary compensation for losses, it does not remove the problem nor does it assist with reducing future losses from predation. Analysis of this alternative in USDA (1997a) shows that it has many drawbacks: Y Compensation would not be practical for public health and safety problems. Y It would require larger expenditures of money to investigate and validate all losses, and to determine and administer appropriate compensation. Y Timely responses to all requests to assess and confirm losses would be difficult, and many losses may not be verified. Y Compensation would give little incentive to limit losses through other management strategies. Y Not all resource managers/owners would rely completely on a compensation program and unregulated lethal control would probably continue and escalate. As stated above, the Indemnity Program only reimburses for losses due to coyote predation, and does not address feral dog, fox, or other predators that attack and kill livestock. Regardless of the predator, compensation for losses does not resolve the initial problem of predation for producers and losses continue. 3.3.2 Coyote Bounties During the early years of game management, many states relied on massive killing efforts (bounties) to reduce predator numbers (e.g., wolves, coyotes, foxes) which were competing with man for game animals (e.g., white-tailed deer). Bounties are not used by most wildlife agencies nor are they supported by WS for predator control because: Y Bounties are not effective in reducing damage. Y Circumstances surrounding take of animals is largely unregulated. Y No process exists to prohibit taking of animals from outside the damage management area for compensation purposes. Y Bounty hunters may mistake dogs and foxes as coyotes. Y Officials responsible for checking in coyotes may mistake dogs and foxes as coyotes. Y Coyote bounties have a long history (>100 years in the U.S.) of use in many states without ever achieving the intended results of reducing damage and population levels (Parker 1995). The overwhelming disadvantage of coyote bounties is the misdirection of funds meant to, but not effectively and economically able to, reduce coyote damage to livestock. 3.3.3 Fertility Control of Predator Populations Fertility control of predator populations may include surgical sterilization (vasectomies or tubal ligations), endocrine regulation (steroids, GnRH [gonadotropine-releasing hormone], antiprogestins), and immunocontraception. Endocrine regulation agents are designed to control hormone levels and regulate fertility in vertebrate species. Immunocontraception uses an individual's own immune system to disrupt reproduction. Although these fertility control methods have shown promise, they can be costly and with the exception of sterilization, need to be administered (boosted) regularly to maintain effectiveness. Many hurdles must be overcome before fertility control becomes a viable wildlife management control alternative. These include, but are not limited to, the development of contraceptive agents that are orally deliverable, species specific, reversible, have few side-effects, and are cost effective (Sanborn et al. 1994). Fertility control is still in the developmental stages and the full effects on wildlife populations and cost effectiveness is being evaluated. The National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) (the research branch of the WS program) is evaluating the effects of fertility control on coyote populations. Preliminary findings indicate that surgically sterilized coyotes maintain pair bonds, defend territories, and kill significantly fewer sheep than unsterilized coyotes. Furthermore, coyotes given multiple porcine zona pellucida (PZP, an immunosterilant) injections are immunologically sterilized and continue to maintain pair-bonds and successfully defend territories in pen tests. These results are promising; however, immunosterilization was not permanent and could break down, allowing previously sterile females to produce offspring. In addition, the effectiveness of surgical sterilization was only cost efficient when it involved 1-3 packs of coyotes. Although there may be some applications for fertility control, use of these methods to protect livestock throughout the State of Ohio would not be cost effective or practical at this time. Fertility control also may effect the genetics of a population over a large area. Because these management techniques are still in the preliminary stages and researchers do not fully understand the effects on wildlife populations, considering fertility control to reduce predation on Ohio's livestock would be precipitous and premature. In addition, before the use of fertility control could be used on predator or other wildlife populations in the State of Ohio, the DOW would need to be consulted and would decide if these methods could be used for population control. The Ohio WS program will keep updated on new findings with regards to fertility control use on predator populations and will consider use of these methods if they become feasible for controlling predation on livestock in Ohio. 3.3.4 Corrective Predator Damage Management Only, No Preventative Damage Management Some people believe lethal management actions should be implemented to stop predation on livestock only after predation has started. These people oppose preventative lethal management actions which may involve removal of coyotes living near livestock operations even though these same livestock operations have chronic historic predation. While WS is unable to predict which predator will kill livestock or which livestock operations will have substantial predator losses, WS can look at historical records for each farm and draw inferences. On livestock operations with historic predator losses, it is likely there will be future losses. Therefore, it is prudent for the livestock manager to have predators removed as good husbandry, especially prior to lambing, kidding, or calving. WS is able to better serve the livestock industry when requests for assistance are more evenly distributed rather than being overwhelmed with requests for service, especially during spring lambing, kidding, and calving. 3.3.5 Require Livestock Producers to Help Themselves before Receiving Assistance from WS Although no law or practices to protect non-lethal methods spent $3.2 and $4.1 policy requires livestock producers to employ husbandry or other predator prevention their livestock, 39% of cattle and 83% of sheep producers in the U.S. report using to help themselves (NASS 1999). In 1998, cattle and sheep producers in the U.S. million on non-lethal management methods, respectively (NASS 1999). Livestock producers in the U.S. employ many lethal and non-lethal management methods to reduce predator losses. The most frequently used non-lethal methods include: guard animals, fencing, shed birthing, herding, night penning, and frightening tactics (NASS 1999). WS policy is to respond to all requests for assistance within program authority, responsibility, and budget. If improved husbandry and other non-lethal methods would reduce predation on livestock, then WS will recommend these practices following the IWDM approach. 3.3.6 No Use of Chemical Methods Much of the public's concern over the use of registered toxicants for predator damage management is based on an erroneous perception that WS uses non-selective, outdated chemical methodologies. In reality, the chemical methods currently used by WS have a high degree of selectivity (see section 4.1.4). WS use of registered toxicants is regulated by the EPA through the FIFRA, by MOU's with other agencies, and by program directives. In addition, APHIS conducted a thorough risk assessment and concluded that chemicals used according to label directions are selective for target individuals or populations, and therefore, have no negligible impacts on the environment (USDA 1997a, Appendix P). The decision to use registered toxicants falls within the WS Decision Model (see section 3.2.3) (Slate et al. 1992). Chemical methods are used because they allow for efficient and effective delivery of service to more livestock producers than would be served if registered toxicants were unavailable. Most registered toxicants have the ability to work during inclement weather and solve predation problems, whereas, traps and snares may be inoperable and shooting impractical in the same inclement weather. 3.3.7 Relocation of Coyotes and Foxes Killing Livestock Section �1501:31-15-03 of the OAC prohibits relocation of raccoons, opossums, skunks, coyotes and foxes in Ohio. Translocation of wildlife is also discouraged by WS policy (WS Directive 2.501) because of stress to the relocated animal, poor survival rates, and difficulties in adapting to new locations or habitats (Nielsen 1988). 3.4 MITIGATION AND SOP'S FOR LIVESTOCK DAMAGE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES 3.4.1 Mitigation Measures Mitigation measures are any features of an action that serve to prevent, reduce, or compensate for impacts that otherwise might result from that action. The current WS program, nationwide and in Ohio, uses many such mitigation measures and these are discussed in detail in Chapter 5 of the ADC FEIS (USDA 1997a). Some key mitigating measures pertinent to the proposed action and alternatives that are incorporated into WS SOP's include the following: Y The WS Decision Model, which is designed to identify effective wildlife damage management strategies and their impacts, would be consistently used. Y Reasonable and prudent alternatives and measures would be established through consultation with the USFWS and would be implemented to avoid adverse impacts to T&E species. Y EPA-approved label directions would be followed for all pesticide use. The registration process for chemical pesticides is intended to assure minimal adverse impacts to the environment when chemicals are used in accordance with label directions. Y All WS employees in the state of Ohio who would use "Restricted Use Pesticides" would be trained and certified as Public Applicators by the ODA, Division of Plant Industry, Pesticide Regulation. Y Non-target animals captured in traps or snares would be released unless it is determined by a WS employee that the animal would not survive and/or that the animal cannot be released safely. Y Conspicuous, bilingual warning signs alerting people to the presence of traps, snares, and chemical control agents may be placed at major access points to areas where WS would be conducting active predator management operations, if it has been determined that the presence of the signs would not impact the efficacy of the management program in the area. Y Research is being conducted to improve management methods and strategies so as to increase selectivity for target species, to develop effective non-lethal control methods, and to evaluate non-target hazards and environmental impacts. Y Preference would be given to non-lethal methods, when practical and effective. If practical and effective non-lethal control methods are not available and if lethal control methods are available and appropriate for WS to implement, WS may implement lethal methods. 3.4.2 Additional Mitigation Measures and SOP's for Wildlife Damage Management Techniques Some additional mitigating factors specific to the current program include the following: Y Generalized population suppression across the State, or even across major portions of the state, would not be conducted. Y WS uses control devices and conducts activities for which the risk of hazards to public safety and hazard to the environment have been determined to be low according to a formal risk assessment (USDA 1997a, Appendix P). Additionally, because most of WS activities are conducted on private lands or other lands of restricted public access, the risk of hazard to the public and their pets would be even further reduced. 3.5 ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES SPECIFIC TO THE ISSUES The following is a summary of additional mitigation measures that are specific to the issues listed in Chapter 2 of this document. 3.5.1 Effects on Target (Coyote and Red Fox) Species Populations Y WS activities conducted to resolve predation on livestock would be directed towards individual problem animals, or local populations or groups, and not towards the eradication of a species or population within an entire area, region, or ecosystem. Y WS lethal take (kill) data would be regularly monitored by WS biologists and would be compliant with the recommended or authorized levels of harvest allowed by the State of Ohio (See Chapter 4). 3.5.2 Effects on Dogs, Wolf-hybrids, and Exotic Carnivores Y If M-44's become registered for use in the State of Ohio, they would not be set from 19 August - 1 March to avoid exposure to hunting dogs. M-44's would be set within fenced areas where non-target dogs are likely to be excluded. In addition, warning signs would be placed at the main entry points of farms and within 25 feet of each M-44 to notify dog owners of this hazard. Y Livestock owners would be requested to notify neighbors with dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores that M-44's have been placed within fenced areas and their pets should be restrained from roaming at large. Y Livestock producers would be instructed to notify hunters requesting and receiving permission to hunt that LPC's, snares, traps, and other control methods are in place on the farm. Y Dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores would be returned to the owner if the animals wear identification and are known not to be the offending predator. 3.5.3 Effects on Non-target Wildlife Populations, Including T&E Species Y The WS Decision Model (Slate et al. 1992) designed to identify the most appropriate damage management strategies and their impacts would be used to minimize impacts on non-target wildlife and avoid impacts on T&E species. Y WS has consulted with the USFWS regarding the nationwide and Ohio programs and would continue to implement all applicable measures identified by the USFWS to ensure protection of T&E species. Y The DOW was a cooperating agency in the development of this EA, and was consulted to mitigate impacts to T&E species. Y WS activities conducted to resolve livestock predation and damage would be directed towards individual problem animals, or local populations or groups, and not towards the eradication of a species or population within an entire area, region, or ecosystem. Y Animals taken by WS would be considered with the statewide total harvest when estimating the impact on native wildlife species. This data would be used to maintain a magnitude of harvest below the level that would affect the viability of a native population. Y When conducting removal operations via shooting, WS would shoot only target species or animals and would not shoot an animal that can not be accurately identified. Y WS employees would use lures, trap placements (sets), and capture devices that are strategically placed at locations likely to capture a target animal and minimize the potential of non-target animal captures. Y No traps would be set within 30 feet of an exposed carcass to preclude capture of eagles and other birds. Y Traps would be selected so foot injuries to captured animals are kept to a minimum (e.g., laminated, offset, or padded jaws; swivels, shock springs, etc.) and would incorporate pan tension devices to avoid capture of non-target species. Y Traps and snares would be checked on a 24-hour basis and would not be placed in areas or trails habitually used by deer or other non-target animals, unless measures are taken to avoid those non-target animals (e.g., jump stick for deer). Y Current regulations require a deer stop (prevents the snare from closing to no more than 2 � inches in diameter) or break away device (breaks open at 350 pounds or less) on all snares used in Ohio. Y The use of traps and snares would conform to current laws and regulations administered by the USFWS, DOW, and WS policy. Y Healthy, uninjured non-target animals captured in traps or snares would be released. Y Injured non-target animals will be treated by a rehabilitator or veterinarian or euthanized, depending on the extent of injury. Y If legalized in Ohio, M-44's and LPC's would be placed within fenced areas where livestock graze to target offending predators and to reduce exposure to non-target wildlife. 3.5.4 Effects on Human Health and Safety Y The WS Decision Model (Slate et al. 1992) designed to identify the most appropriate damage management strategies and their impacts would be used to capture the target species and minimize impacts on human health and safety. Y WS control operations would be conducted professionally and in the safest manner possible. Most trapping and snaring would be conducted away from areas of high human activity and when determined necessary, signs would be placed to warn the public of any potential hazards. Y All pesticides used by WS would be registered with EPA and ODA. EPA label directions would be followed by WS for all pesticides used in Ohio. Y All WS certified pesticide applicators who use "Restricted-Use Pesticides" would participate in ODA approved continuing education to keep informed of developments and maintain their certifications. Y If legalized in Ohio, all WS employees using M-44's would carry antidote kits at all times, wear leather gloves and safety glasses, and will pass a written test prior to receiving certification to use M-44's. Y If legalized in Ohio, all LPC applicators would wear latex gloves when handling collared sheep or goats and will pass a written test prior to receiving certification to use LPC's. Y Warning signs indicating the placement of traps, snares, M-44's, or LPC's on a farm would be placed at the main entry points. Y WS predator management via shooting would be conducted professionally and in the safest manner possible. Shooting would be conducted during time periods when public activity and access to the control areas are restricted. WS personnel involved in shooting operations would be fully trained in the proper and safe application of this method. Y All WS employees using firearms would receive firearms training at least every 3 years. 3.5.5 Humaneness of Control Methods Used by WS Y WS employees would be well trained in the latest and most humane devices/methods for removing problem wildlife. Y WS personnel would attempt to dispatch captured target animals as quickly and humanely as possible. In most field situations, a precise shot to the brain using a small caliber firearm would be performed. This method causes rapid unconsciousness followed by the cessation of heart and respirator functions, resulting in a humane and rapid death. This method is in concert with the AVMA definition of euthanasia. Y The NWRC is continually conducting research, with the goal, to improve the selectivity and humaneness of wildlife damage management devices used by WS personnel in the field. 3.5.6 Effects on the Aesthetic Values of Target and Non-target Species Y Dead animals would be kept from public view when placed in government vehicles traveling on public roads. In addition, dead animals would not be disposed of in locations where the public is likely to see the animals. Y WS employees would avoid euthanizing animals when the public is present. CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES INTRODUCTION Chapter 4 provides information needed for making informed decisions on the livestock protection/predator damage management objectives outlined in Chapter 1 and the issues and affected environment discussed in Chapter 2. This chapter analyzes the environmental consequences of each alternative in relation to the issues identified for detailed analysis in Chapter 3. This chapter analyzes the environmental consequences of each alternative in comparison with the No Action Alternative to determine if the real or potential impacts would be greater, lesser, or the same. Therefore, the No Action Alternative serves as the baseline for the analysis and the comparison of expected impacts among the alternatives. The analysis also takes into consideration WS mandates, directives, and the procedures used in the WS decision process (USDA 1997a). The following resource values within the State of Ohio are not expected to be significantly impacted by any of the alternatives analyzed: soils, geology, minerals, water quality/quantity, flood plains, wetlands, visual resources, critical habitats (areas listed in T&E species recovery plans), air quality, prime and unique farmlands, aquatic resources, timber, and range. These resources will not be analyzed further. Cumulative Impacts: Discussed in relationship to each of the potentially affected species analyzed in this chapter. Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources: Other than minor uses of fuels for motor vehicles and other materials, there are no irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources. Impacts on sites or resources protected under the NHPA: WS actions are not undertakings that could adversely affect historic resources (See Section 1.8.2.4). ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED IN DETAIL Alternative 1 - No Action, Technical Assistance Only - This alternative precludes any and all IWDM direct control activities by WS to protect livestock from predation in Ohio. Producers or any other entity directed at preventing or reducing predation of livestock could conduct IWDM direct control activities in the absence of WS involvement. However, if requested, affected producers would be provided with technical assistance information only. Alternative 2 - Non-lethal Control Only - This alternative would involve the use and recommendation of non-lethal management techniques only by WS. Alternative 3 - Non-lethal Control before Lethal Control - This alternative would not allow the use or recommendation of lethal control by WS until all available non-lethal methods had been applied and determined to be inadequate in each damage situation. Alternative 4 - Lethal Control Only - This alternative would involve the use and recommendation of lethal management techniques only by WS. Alternative 5 - Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (Proposed Action) - This alternative would incorporate an integrated approach to wildlife damage management using components of the wildlife damage management techniques and methods addressed in Alternatives 2-4 as deemed appropriate by WS and other participating entities. Alternative 6 - No Federal WS Predator Damage Management in Ohio - This alternative would result in no assistance from WS in reducing predator damage to livestock in Ohio. WS would not provide technical assistance or operational damage management services. 4.1 DETAILED ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES 4.1.1 Effects on Target (Coyote and Red Fox) Species Populations The analysis for magnitude of impact generally follows the process described in Chapter 4 of USDA (1997a). Magnitude is described in USDA (1997a) as " . . . a measure of the number of animals killed in relation to their abundance." Magnitude may be determined either quantitatively or qualitatively. Quantitative determinations are based on population estimates, allowable harvest levels, and actual harvest data. Qualitative determinations are based on population trends and harvest data when available. Generally, WS would only conduct damage management on species where population densities are high and only after they have caused damage. Ecology of Coyotes Prior to 1900, the distribution of the coyote was mainly limited to the short grass prairie region of the western United States (Parker 1995). Two separate colonization events occurred on a northern and southern front as coyotes expanded their range into the eastern United States (Parker 1995 and Moore and Parker 1992). The northern front began at the turn of the century as wolves were extirpated and habitat changes (i.e. clearing of forests) left a niche that was later filled by coyotes (Parker 1995). On the southern front, the main thrust of the expanding coyote population did not cross the Mississippi River basin until the 1960's (Parker 1995). The extirpation of the red wolf and the loss of forest habitat in the south was also favorable for coyotes (Parker 1995). The first confirmed report of a coyote in Ohio was in Logan County in 1919 and Guernsey County in 1920 (Weeks et al. 1990). The coyote now is found in every county in Ohio. Coyote pelage typically are distinguished by four color phases which range from dark brown to blond or reddish-blond, but the most common (typical) is an overall gray-brown, with tan legs, rufus flanks, rich rufus ears, and grizzled gray frontals (Hilton 1978). While melanism has been considered a diagnostic feature useful for determining red wolves from coyotes (Parker 1995), Gipson (1978) suggests melanistic coyotes are the result of hybridization among coyotes and red wolves. Eastern coyotes are generally larger than their western counterparts. Hilton (1978) reported that the average weight of coyotes throughout the east is less than 40 pounds. Food habits of eastern coyotes include white-tailed deer, rabbits and rodents, fruits and berries, livestock, birds, and carrion. The white-tailed deer may provide up to 60% of a coyotes diet from January through April and up to 70% in June and July when fawns are especially susceptible (Witmer et al. 1995, Lavigne 1995, Blanton and Hill 1989). Coyotes breed in late-January through February. After a 63 day gestation cycle, an average of 5 to 7 pups are born (Chambers 1992). Both adults feed the pups with the possibility of unmated coyotes living in the group contributing as well (Snow 1967). The pups usually stay with the adults through the fall and may disperse before the next breeding cycle in February. Eighty-seven percent of the juveniles will disperse after 12 months and all by 19 months (Lorenz 1978). Radio-marked juveniles dispersed from October through January for distances of 10-42 miles with an average of 30 miles (Berg and Chesness 1978). The cost to accurately determine absolute coyote densities over large areas would be prohibitive (Connolly 1992) and would not appear to be warranted for this EA given the coyote's relative abundance. Because determinations of absolute coyote densities are frequently limited to educated guesses (Knowlton 1972), many researchers have estimated coyote populations throughout the west and east (Pyrah 1984, Camenzind 1978, Knowlton 1972, Clark 1972, USDI 1979). The presence of unusual food concentrations and non-breeding helpers at the den can influence coyote densities and complicate efforts to estimate abundance (Danner and Smith 1980). Coyote densities range from 0.2/mi2 when populations are low (pre-whelping) to 3.6/mi2 when populations are high (post-whelping) (USDI 1979, Knowlton 1972). Knowlton (1972) concluded that coyote densities may approach a high of 5-6/mi2 under extremely favorable conditions with densities of 0.5 to 1.0/mi2 possible throughout much of their range. The literature on coyote spatial organization is confusing (Windberg and Knowlton 1988, Messier and Barrette 1982). Coyotes are highly mobile animals with home ranges that vary by sex, age of the animal, and season of the year (Pyrah 1984, Althoff 1978, Todd and Keith 1976). Coyote home ranges may vary from 2.0 to 21.3 mi2 (Andelt and Gipson 1979, Lovell 1996). Ozoga and Harger (1966), Edwards (1975), and Danner (1976) observed overlap between coyote home ranges and did not consider coyotes to be territorial. Other studies have shown that coyotes occupy territories and that each territory may have several non-breeding helpers at the den during whelping (Allen et al. 1987, Bekoff and Wells 1982). Therefore, each coyote territory may support more than just a pair of coyotes. Gese et al. (1988) reported that coyote groups of 2, 3, 4, and 5 comprised 40%, 37%, 10% and 6% of the resident population, respectively, and Messier and Barrette (1982) reported that during November through April, 35% of the coyotes were in groups of 3 to 5 animals. The unique resilience of the coyote, its ability to adapt, and its perseverance under adverse conditions is commonly recognized among biologists and land managers. Despite intensive historical damage management efforts in livestock production areas and despite sport hunting and trapping for fur, coyotes continue to thrive and expand their range, occurring widely across North and Central America (Miller 1995). Connolly and Longhurst (1975) determined that, "if 75% of the coyotes are killed each year, the population would be exterminated in slightly over 50 years." However, the authors go on to explain that their "model suggests that coyotes, through compensatory reproduction, can withstand an annual population mortality of 70%" and that coyote populations would regain pre-control densities (through recruitment, reproduction and migration) by the end of the fifth year after control was terminated even though 75% mortality had occurred for 20 years. In addition, other researchers (Windberg and Knowlton 1988) recognized that immigration, (not considered in the Connolly and Longhurst (1975) model) can result in rapid occupancy of vacant territories, which helps to explain why coyotes have thrived in spite of early efforts to exterminate them (Connolly 1978). Ecology of Red Foxes Red foxes are the most common and well-known species in the genus Vulpes and are the most widely distributed non-specific predators in the world (Voigt 1987). The red fox occurs throughout Ohio and prefers diverse habitat that is made up of a patchwork of woodlots, open meadows, dense brushlands, pastures, and small wetlands (Henry 1986). Red fox were native to North America north of latitude 40� (Churcher 1959). European red fox were introduced into the eastern seaboard area about 1750 (Churcher 1959). Thomas (1951), discussing the distribution of animals in Ohio, wrote, "fulva also had a northerly range in pre-Columbian times, from which it spread southward and southeastward with the clearing of the forests." Red foxes probably came into Ohio between 1750 and 1800, some native animals coming from the North and other introduced animals entering from Pennsylvania and Virginia. Red foxes are regarded as nuisance predators in many regions, preying on wildlife and livestock, and have become notorious in many areas of the world as carriers of diseases (Ables 1969, Andrews et al. 1973, Tabel et al. 1974, Tullar et al. 1976, Pils and Martin 1978, Sargeant 1978, Voigt 1987, Allen and Sargeant 1993). Red foxes have been the subject of many studies during the last 20 years and investigations have revealed that foxes are extremely adaptive and diverse in their behavior and use of habitats. For example, Voigt and Earle (1983) and Gese et al. (1996) showed that red foxes were adaptive enough to avoid coyotes while coexisting in the same area and habitats. Adult red foxes normally weigh between 6 and 15 pounds. The dorsal pelage is normally rustyreddish to reddish-yellow intermixed with dark hairs in the middle of the back, while the fronts of the legs, feet, and back of ears are black, and the tail tip is white. The under parts are whitish or grayish-white. Three color phases have been reported: "cross" (pelage is mixed with gray and yellow, and gets its name from black cross formed by a line down the mid-back and another across the shoulders), "silver" (melanistic coat frosted with white), and "black" phases that are progressively darker. Red foxes feeding habits are governed by the relative availability of foods with rabbits and mice usually making up over half of the food consumed (Nelson 1933). Other foods include, squirrels, muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), quail, song birds, insects, fruits and nuts (Pils and Martin 1978). Red fox densities are difficult to determine because of the species' secretive and elusive nature. However, researchers have documented that the red fox has high reproductive and dispersal rates and thus, can withstand high mortality (Allen and Sargeant 1993, Voigt 1987, Voigt and MacDonald 1984, Harris 1979, Pils and Martin 1978, Storm et al. 1976, Andrews et al. 1973, Phillips and Mech 1970). Storm et al. (1976) stated that 95% of red fox females (44% were less than 1 year old) bred successfully in a population in Illinois and Iowa. Rowlands and Parkes (1935) and Creed (1960) reported that male red foxes successfully bred females during their first year. Red foxes average 4.7 pups per litter with litters of 14 to 17 pups documented (Storm et al. 1976, Voigt 1987). Ables (1969) and Sheldon (1950) reported that more than 1 female was observed at the den and suggested that red foxes have "helpers" that assist with raising pups, a phenomena observed in coyotes and other canids. Red fox population densities ranged from more than 50/mi2 (Harris 1977, Harris and Rayner 1986, MacDonald and Newdick 1982) where food was abundant, to 2.6/mi2 in Ontario (Voigt 1987), and to 1 fox den/3 mi2 in Nebraska (Sargeant 1972). Dispersal serves to equalize fox densities over large areas. Annual harvests in localized areas in 1 or more years will likely have little impact on the overall population in subsequent years, but may reduce localized predation (Allen and Sargeant 1993). Phillips (1970) stated that fox populations are resilient and in order for fox control (by trapping) to be successful, pressure on the population must be almost continuous. Phillips (1970) and Voigt (1987) also concluded that habitat destruction affects fox populations to a greater extent than short-term over-harvest. Coyote and Red Fox Populations in Ohio The DOW provided harvest data (Table 4.1), but was unable to provide any definitive estimates of population sizes for purposes of the following analyses on impacts to the population. Therefore, WS used the best available information to produce reasonable estimates. Table 4.1. Annual take of furbearing animals taken by licensed hunters and trappers in Ohio as reported by Ohio fur dealers1, 1989-90 to 1999-00. # of licensed fur harvesters2 7,691 5,107 Furbearer species Red fox Gray fox 5,468 3,382 4,160 3,168 Year 1989-90 1990-91 Coyote 68 102 Raccoon 88,128 62,090 Number Seen/1,000 Hours Hunted 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 22,229 464 1,547 770 105,014 1999-00 20,403 534 1,289 528 46,992 5,067 4,716 4,257 5,586 20,057 23,151 24,597 20 219 320 479 642 1,755 538 426 4,860 2,952 2,709 3,117 2,766 2,192 2,418 5,226 2,580 2,846 2,911 1,755 1,715 1,144 139,182 111,965 107,474 155,811 126,998 156,593 186,945 Coyote Red Fox 15 10 5 0 1990 1991 1 - Numbers do not include furs Year sold outside of Ohio nor animals legally taken and not sold for fur. 2 - Fur Taker Permits were not required until the 1995-96 hunting/trapping season. 1992 1993 1995 1996 1997 1994 1998 Coyote populations in Ohio are considered increasing based on trends in bow hunter surveys conducted by the DOW (Figure 4.1). The DOW, the state authority responsible for monitoring and managing coyotes in Ohio believes coyote populations are increasing based on available data (C. Dwyer, Ohio Division of Wildlife, Oak Harbor, Ohio, personal communication). Red fox population trends in Ohio declined until 1995, but now appear to be remaining stable based on bow hunter surveys conducted by the DOW (Figure 4.1). 1999 Figure 4.1. Population Trend Data for Coyotes and Red Foxes in Ohio based on Ohio Division of Wildlife bow hunter surveys, 1990-1999. Alternative 1 - No Action, Technical Assistance Only Under this alternative, WS would not be involved in control of coyote and red fox predation to livestock, other than by providing technical assistance. WS would have no direct impact on coyote and red fox populations. Impacts on coyote and red fox under this alternative could be the same, less, or more than those of the proposed action depending on the level of effort expended by the land managers, but would likely be less than Alternative 6 since WS would be providing technical information to resource owners. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to reduce losses could lead to illegal use of chemical toxicants which could lead to real but unknown impacts on coyote or red fox populations. Alternative 2 - Non-lethal Control Only Under this alternative, WS would only implement non-lethal control methods and would not impact coyote or red fox populations. If non-lethal methods were successful in alleviating damage and the resource owner did not implement lethal control actions there would be no impact to coyote and fox populations by affected resource owners. However, in those situations where non-lethal methods were ineffective, the resource owner would likely reject WS non-lethal assistance and implement their own lethal control program resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 3 - Non-lethal Control Before Lethal Control Under this alternative, WS would implement non-lethal control prior to the use of lethal methods. WS impacts to coyote and fox populations would be similar to Alternative 2 in those cases were non-lethal methods effectively reduced predation levels to acceptable levels and would be similar to the proposed action when lethal methods were implemented by WS. However, because non-lethal control must be applied before lethal control, predation to livestock may not be reduced in a timely and effective manner. In those situations, resource owners may be unwilling to accept further losses as all available non-lethal methods are applied. This could result in resource owners rejecting WS non-lethal methods and implement their own lethal control program resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 4 - Lethal Control Only Under this alternative, WS would implement and recommend lethal control methods without applying or considering non-lethal methods. In many situations, WS lethal methods would be applied as a result of unsuccessful attempts by land managers to alleviate predator damage through non-lethal methods resulting in impacts similar to the proposed action. In those situations where non-lethal methods were not implemented by resource owners, it is likely that a greater number of coyotes or red fox would have to be removed lethally by WS. However, based upon the population analysis provided under the proposed action, this potential increase in take would not result in adverse effects to local, regional or statewide coyote and red fox populations. Alternative 5 - Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (Proposed Action) Under this alternative, WS would incorporate select components form Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. As stated in Section 2.2.1, it is unlikely that WS would negatively impact target coyote and red fox populations on a local, regional, or statewide scale under this alternative. Some local reduction in coyote and red fox populations may occur in localized areas where lethal control activities are implemented, but not to an extent that predator species would be permanently extirpated from an area. Local and regional immigration and emigration of coyotes and red foxes would be expected to replace removed target animals after a relatively short period of time. Coyote and Red Fox Population Impact Analysis Coyotes Coyotes can become a nuisance species (ORC �955.51 and OAC �1501:31-15-03) and are a nonnative furbearer legally hunted and trapped in Ohio. They are also a pest species killed by farmers and other citizens because of the damage coyotes cause to livestock, agricultural crops, property, threats to human safety, or natural resources. The number of coyotes killed by farmers and other citizens is unknown and not measured by any survey. Hunters and trappers legally removed at least 534 coyotes in Ohio during the 1999-00 hunting and trapping season as reported by fur dealers (Table 4.1). These numbers grossly underestimate the actual take by hunters and trappers in Ohio because many coyote pelts are sold to out-of-state fur dealers and auctions and were not represented in these data. In addition, many coyotes may have been shot or trapped by livestock producers and the fur pelts never sold. Therefore, the actual harvest of coyotes in Ohio is much higher than data presented in this EA. The DOW, as the agency with management responsibility for wildlife in Ohio has classified the coyote as a furbearing mammal with few restrictions on sport harvest, depredation harvest, or season of take. Furthermore, to liberalize legal take of coyotes in Ohio, the DOW removed the requirement of hunters and trappers to acquire a furbearer permit and now only require a valid hunting license. Even though there is no season or restriction of harvest, coyote sightings from bow hunter surveys continue to increase (Figure 4.1). WS has not adversely impacted the coyote population in similar programs in the Eastern U.S. (e.g., West Virginia and Virginia) and expects that the coyote take in Ohio would be minor compared to sport and other depredation take allowed by the DOW. Since depredating coyotes may already be killed by resource owners, the status quo for coyote populations and human-caused coyote mortality in Ohio would not be significantly affected with or without the involvement of the WS program. WS anticipates to kill no more than 500 coyotes annually under the proposed action. Therefore, 500 coyotes was used to analyze potential impacts to the statewide coyote population in Ohio. The ADC FEIS (USDA 1997a) determined magnitude of total harvest using qualitative information based on State population trends. Magnitude is defined as a measure of the number of animals killed in relation to their abundance. Using the annual take of 500 coyotes by WS and the increasing trend of coyote populations in the State, the magnitude is considered extremely low for WS take of coyotes in Ohio. Thus, cumulative take appears to be far beneath the level that would begin to cause a decline in the coyote population. DOW biologists have concurred with WS's finding that WS predator damage management activities will have no adverse effect on statewide coyote populations (Appendix E). This information assures that cumulative impacts on the coyote population are within those desired by the State and would thus have no significant adverse impact on the quality of the human environment. Red fox Red fox are a furbearer species legally hunted and trapped in Ohio. In addition, red fox may be killed by landowners if they are causing damage to agricultural crops, property, threats to human health safety, or threatened and endangered species (OAC �1501:31-15-03). The number of red fox killed by landowners and other citizens is unknown and not measured by any survey. Hunter and trappers legally removed at least 1,289 red foxes in Ohio during the 1999-00 hunting and trapping season as reported by fur dealers (Table 2.5). Similar to coyotes, these numbers underestimate the actual take by hunters and trappers in Ohio because many red fox pelts are sold to out-of-state fur dealers and auctions and were not represented in these data. It is likely that fewer red fox than coyotes are shot by livestock producers because red fox are involved in fewer depredations on livestock than coyotes in Ohio. Therefore, the actual harvest of red foxes in Ohio may be much higher than data presented in this EA. WS expects that its red fox take would be minor compared to sport and other depredation take allowed by the DOW. The DOW, as the agency with management responsibility for wildlife in Ohio has classified the red fox as a furbearing mammal and there are few restrictions on sport and depredation harvest. Even though there are few restrictions on harvest during the legal red fox trapping/hunting season, red fox population trends have remained stable since 1995 based on the bow hunters survey conducted by the DOW (Figure 4.1). Since depredating red fox may already be killed by resources owners, the status quo for red fox populations and human-caused red fox mortality in Ohio would not be significantly different with or without the involvement of the WS program. WS anticipates to kill no more than 100 red fox annually under the proposed action. Therefore, 100 red fox was used to analyze potential impacts to the statewide red fox population in Ohio. The ADC FEIS (USDA 1997a) determined magnitude of total harvest using qualitative information based on State population trends. Magnitude is defined as a measure of the number of animals killed in relation to their abundance. Using the annual take of 100 red fox by WS and the stable trend of red fox populations in the State, the magnitude is considered moderate to low for WS take of red fox in Ohio. Thus, cumulative take appears to be far beneath the level that would begin to cause a decline in the red fox population. DOW biologists have concurred with WS's finding that WS predator damage management activities will have no adverse effect on statewide red fox populations (Appendix E). This information assures that cumulative impacts on the red fox population are within those desired by the State and would thus have no significant adverse impact on the quality of the human environment. Alternative 6 - No Federal WS Predator Damage Management in Ohio Coyote and red fox populations could continue to increase where trapping, hunting, and depredation take was low and some populations would decline or stabilize where trapping, hunting and depredation take was adequate. Some resource owners experiencing damage would trap or shoot coyotes and red fox, or hire private trappers but would receive no guidance from WS regarding these options. Resource owners experiencing damage may take illegal or unsafe action against local populations of coyote and red fox out of frustration of continued damage. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to reduce losses could lead to illegal use of chemical toxicants which could lead to real but unknown impacts on coyote or red fox populations. Impacts on coyote and red fox under this alternative could be the same, less, or more than those of the proposed action depending on the level of effort expended by the resource owner. 4.1.2 Effects on Dogs, Wolf-hybrids, and Exotic Carnivores Alternative 1 - No Action, Technical Assistance Only Under this alternative, WS would not be involved in control of dog, wolf-hybrid, or exotic carnivore predation to livestock, other than by providing technical assistance. WS would have no direct impact on dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore populations. Impacts on dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore populations under this alternative could be the same, less, or more than those of the proposed action depending on the level of effort expended by the resource owner, but would likely be less than Alternative 6 since WS would be providing information to resource owner. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to reduce losses could lead to illegal use of chemical toxicants which could lead to real but unknown impacts on dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore populations. Alternative 2 - Non-lethal Control Only Under this alternative, WS would only implement non-lethal control methods and would not directly effect dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores. If non-lethal methods were successful in alleviating damage and the resource owner did not implement lethal control actions there would be no impact to dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore populations by affected resource owners except if livestock producers use guard dogs (a non-lethal method) recommended by WS, then some hunting or companion dogs may be killed by guard dogs if those dogs enter pastures protected by guard dogs. However in those situations where non-lethal methods were ineffective, the resource owner would likely reject WS non-lethal assistance and implement their own lethal control program resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 3 - Non-lethal Control Before Lethal Control Under this alternative, WS would implement non-lethal control prior to the use of lethal methods. WS impacts to dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore populations would be similar to Alternative 2 in those cases were non-lethal methods effectively reduced predation levels to acceptable levels and would be similar to the proposed action when lethal methods were implemented by WS. However, because non-lethal control must be applied before lethal control, predation to livestock may not be reduced in a timely and effective manner. In those situations, resource owners may be unwilling to accept further losses as all available non-lethal methods are applied. This could result in resource owners rejecting WS non-lethal methods and implement their own lethal control program resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 4 - Lethal Control Only Under this alternative, WS would implement and recommend lethal control methods without applying or considering non-lethal methods. Unfortunately, some dog owners fail to follow state laws by restraining their dogs, putting these dogs at risk. Some dogs are at risk because a few hunters fail to get landowner permission and they trespass unaware of the hazards their dogs may encounter. In many situations, WS lethal methods would be applied as a result of unsuccessful attempts by land managers to alleviate predator damage through non-lethal methods resulting in impacts similar to the proposed action. In those situations where non-lethal methods were not implemented by resource owners, it is likely that a greater number of dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivores would have to be removed lethally by WS. However, based upon the analysis provided under the proposed action, this potential increase in take would not result in adverse effects to local, regional or statewide dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore populations. Alternative 5 - Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (Proposed Action) Under this alternative, WS would incorporate select components form Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. As stated in Section 2.2.2, it is unlikely that WS would negatively impact dog, wolf-hybrid, or exotic carnivore pets on a local, regional, or statewide scale under this alternative. Removal of the offending animal may occur in localized areas where lethal control activities are implemented, but not to an extent that companion animals would be impacted. Dog owners are required under the ORC (� 955.22) to keep their pets and hunting dogs restrained and under reasonable control; therefore, these animals should not be impacted by WS activities. Some pet owners release these animals into the country after they find they cannot keep these animals as pets for various reasons (e.g., amount of food required, size and aggressiveness, etc.). These animals become hungry and indiscriminate killers and because they are not afraid of humans, they attack and kill pets and livestock. Because these feral animals are the individuals targeted by WS, hunting and companion animals properly and legally restrained by pet owners would not be harmed by WS activities. Alternative 6 - No Federal WS Predator Damage Management in Ohio. Some resource owners experiencing damage would lethally remove depredating dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores but would receive no guidance from WS. Resource owners experiencing damage may take illegal or unsafe action against local populations of dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivores out of frustration of continued damage. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to reduce losses could lead to illegal use of chemical toxicants which could lead to real but unknown impacts on dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore populations. Impacts on dog, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore populations under this alternative could be the same, less, or more than those of the proposed action depending on the level of effort expended by the resource owner. 4.1.3 Effects on Non-target Wildlife Populations, including T&E Species Alternative 1 - No Action, Technical Assistance Only Under this alternative, WS would not be involved in any direct control methods to reduce livestock predation; therefore, there would be no impact by WS on any non-target or T&E species. However, predation to livestock would continue throughout Ohio, providing that land managers did not implement their own wildlife damage management program. Efforts by land managers and other entities to reduce or prevent depredations could increase, potentially resulting in adverse affects to non-target species such as: bobcats (Felis rufus), black bears (Ursus americanus), river otters (Lutra canadensis), and bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus); all listed as "State Endangered" in the State of Ohio (Appendix D). For example, shooting, trapping, and snaring by persons not proficient at mammal identification could lead to capture or killing of non-target and T&E species. Even though WS is providing technical information, measures to avoid capturing non-target and T&E species may not be employed by resource owners, leading to impacts similar to Alternative 6. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to reduce predation losses could lead to illegal use of chemical toxicants which could impact non-target and T&E species. Hazards to raptors, including bald eagles, could also be greater under this alternative if chemicals that are less selective or that cause secondary poisoning are used by frustrated private individuals. Alternative 2 - Non-lethal Control Only Under this alternative, no risks to wildlife populations or T&E species by WS activities are anticipated since WS would only implement non-lethal control methods to reduce livestock predation. If livestock producers use guard dogs (a non-lethal method) recommended by WS, some non-target species may be killed if those animals enter pastures protected by guard dogs. Landowners experiencing livestock predation problems which were not effectively resolved by non-lethal control methods and recommendations would likely resort to other means of control such as use of shooting, trapping, and snaring by private persons or even illegal use of chemical toxicants. These measures may result in less experienced persons implementing control methods and may lead to greater take of non-target and T&E species than the proposed action. For example, trapping or snaring by persons not proficient at mammal sign identification could lead to killing more deer, fox, raccoon, bobcats, and other animals than the proposed action. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to reduce losses could lead to illegal use of chemical toxicants which could lead to unknown impacts on non-target and T&E species populations. Hazards to raptors, including bald eagles, could therefore be greater under this alternative if chemicals that are less selective or that cause secondary poisoning are used by frustrated private individuals. Alternative 3 - Non-lethal Control Before Lethal Control Under this alternative, WS would implement non-lethal control prior to the use of lethal methods. As stated in Section 2.2.3, it is not likely that WS would negatively impact non-target or T&E species populations on a local, regional, or statewide scale under this alternative. WS impacts to non-target and T&E species populations would be similar to Alternative 2 in those cases were non-lethal methods effectively reduced predation levels to acceptable levels and would be similar to the proposed action when lethal methods were implemented by WS. However, because non-lethal control must be applied before lethal control, predation to livestock may not be reduced in a timely and effective manner. In those situations, resource owners may be unwilling to accept further losses as all available non-lethal methods are applied. This could result in resource owners rejecting WS non-lethal methods and implement their own lethal control program resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 4 - Lethal Control Only Under this alternative, WS would implement and recommend lethal control methods without applying or considering non-lethal methods. WS impacts to non-target and T&E species would be similar to the proposed action. Alternative 5 - Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (Proposed Action) Under this alternative, WS would incorporate select components form Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. As stated in Section 2.2.3, it is unlikely that WS would negatively impact non-target and T&E species populations on a local, regional, or statewide scale under this alternative. No adverse impacts on any of the listed birds, mammals, invertebrates, fish, reptiles, amphibians, or plants (Appendices C and D) are expected by WS operational activities. However, it is possible that WS may capture bobcats, a state listed species, while attempting to capture the offending predator. WS will make every attempt to avoid capturing bobcats and, if captured, will ensure they are released unharmed. Regardless of the outcome (released or unintentionally killed), the DOW will be contacted and informed of the situation and if killed, the carcass will be provided for necropsy data. DOW biologists have concurred with WS's finding that WS predator damage management activities will have no adverse effects on local, regional, or statewide wildlife and State Listed T&E species populations (Appendix E). No effects on Federally classified Threatened or Endangered species are expected from this alternative. Mitigation measures to avoid T&E impacts were described in Chapter 3 (Section 3.5.3). Non-target or T&E species that are inadvertently captured in live traps (i.e., foothold traps and snares) would be released, if it is determined that it is safe to do so and if the animal is injury free. Non-target and T&E species captures are minimized by WS selection of appropriate trap size, pan tension, attractants (baits), and site selection. Daily trap checks would further minimize risk to non-target and T&E species. Risks associated with snares are greatest for animals that frequent the areas where snares are placed and travel along paths of the targeted animals. Non-target and T&E species risks will further be minimized by adjusting the size of the snare loop and the height of placement. Proper loop size and placement allows animals smaller than the target species to pass under or through the snare unharmed and those animals larger than the target species to step or jump over the snare. The use of break-away locks and stops (device used to prevent a snare from completely closing) would allow animals larger than the target species to break free of the snare or to be released. The inherent safety features of M-44's and LPC's that preclude or minimize hazards to mammals and plants are described in Appendix B and in a formal risk assessment in the ADC FEIS (USDA 1997a, Appendix P). Those measures and characteristics assure there would be no jeopardy to T&E species or adverse impacts on mammalian or non-T&E bird scavengers from the proposed action. If legalized in Ohio, the use of M-44 devices and Livestock Protection Collars would only be used in areas where it is determined (through consultation with the USFWS and the DOW) that non-target (especially T&E) species would not be affected by the use of these control methods. In addition, M-44's and LPC's would only be used when traps and snares prove ineffective, and then only when these control devices can be used safely and specifically on the target animal. WS activities in the OCLPP may indirectly benefit some species that are preyed upon by coyotes, red foxes, feral dogs, wolf-hybrids, and exotic carnivores. The benefits would be highly localized and most likely on the property WS is assisting, or on adjacent properties of those landowners. The wildlife species likely to benefit because of the reduced threat of predation include: white-tailed deer, groundhogs, rabbits, mice and voles, bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), ruffed grouse, and wild turkey. Alternative 6 - No Federal WS Predator Damage Management in Ohio In the absence of WS assistance, some resource owners may attempt to remove predators or hire private trappers with little or no trapping experience. These resource owners or trappers would be more likely than WS personnel to trap non-target species and not report non-target take. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to reduce predation losses could lead to illegal use of chemical toxicants which could impact non-target and T&E species. Hazards to raptors, including bald eagles, could also be greater under this alternative if chemicals that are less selective or that cause secondary poisoning are used by frustrated private individuals. 4.1.4 Effects on Human Health and Safety Alternative 1 - No Action, Technical Assistance Only Under this alternative, WS would not be involved in any direct control methods to reduce livestock predation; therefore, there would be no impact on human health or safety by WS. Private efforts to reduce or prevent damage would be expected to increase, resulting in less experienced persons implementing damage management methods and potentially leading to greater risk to human health and safety than the Proposed Action, although not to the point that they would be substantial. Individuals that are less experienced with firearms, traps and snares may not be selective when targeting predators, thus increasing the potential to injure humans. In addition, hazards to humans could be greater under this alternative if chemicals that are less selective and cause secondary poisoning are used. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to alleviate damage could lead to illegal use of certain toxicants that could pose secondary poisoning hazards to pets and to mammalian and avian scavengers. Some chemicals that could be used illegally would present greater risks of adverse effects on humans than those recommended under the Proposed Action. Alternative 2 - Non-lethal Control Only Under this alternative, only non-lethal methods would be used or recommended by WS. A formal risk assessment of WS operational management methods found that risks to human safety were low (USDA 1997a, Appendix P). There are currently no registered non-lethal chemicals available for use on predators; therefore, any concerns of WS use of chemicals would be eliminated under this alternative. However, excessive cost or ineffectiveness of non-lethal techniques could result in some entities rejecting WS assistance and resorting to other means of control, including the possibility of illegal use of pesticides, resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 3 - Non-lethal Control Before Lethal Control Under this alternative, WS would be required to implement non-lethal methods prior to the implementation of lethal methods. WS impacts on human health and safety would be similar to Alternative 2 in those cases where non-lethal methods effectively reduced predation levels to acceptable levels and would be similar to the proposed action when lethal methods were implemented by WS. However, because non-lethal control must be applied before lethal control, predation to livestock may not be reduced in a timely and effective manner. In those situations, resource owners may be unwilling to accept further losses as all available non-lethal methods are applied. This could result in resource owners rejecting WS non-lethal methods and implement their own lethal control program resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 4 - Lethal Control Only Under this alternative, WS would implement and recommend lethal control methods without applying or considering non-lethal methods to reduce predation on livestock in Ohio. WS impacts on human health and safety would be similar to the proposed action. Alternative 5 - Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (Proposed Action) Under this alternative, WS would incorporate select components from Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. A formal risk assessment of WS operational management methods found that risks to human safety were low (USDA 1997a, Appendix P). In addition, APHIS conducted a thorough Risk Assessment, and concluded that, WS use of chemical methods are in accordance with label directions, and are highly selective to target individuals or populations, and such use has negligible impacts on the environment (USDA 1997a). Methods that may be used by WS include: trapping, snaring, shooting, and calling and shooting (and if legalized in Ohio, the M-44 device, LPC, and Large Gas Cartridge). Trapping and snaring Traps and snares may be used or recommended by WS and do not pose a threat to human health and safety. There are many misconceptions about foothold traps and snares. Regulations exist to prohibit use of traps that cause damage to the user or anyone that may encounter a set trap (in Ohio the legal jaw spread must be < 5 5/8"). In addition, the BMP process addresses user safety ensuring that traps and snares are safe. It is possible that an individual may accidentally step into a trap and get their toe caught; however, a person can easily pull their foot out of the trap without damage or even a bruise. Similarly, it is unlikely that an individual would get entangled in a snare set for a target species. However, one can easily remove a snare by pushing the locking device in the opposite direction to open up the snare loop. More detailed information about traps and snares are provided in Section 2.2.4.2 and Appendix B. Shooting and calling and shooting WS personnel may occasionally employ or recommend the use of rifles and shotguns to remove target species preying upon or attempting to prey upon livestock. Handguns may also be used to humanely euthanize trapped or snared animals. WS SOP's include measures intended to mitigate or reduce the effects on human health and safety and are presented in Chapter 3. Safety issues related to the misuse of firearms and the potential human hazards associated with firearms use are concerns both to the public and WS. To ensure safe use and awareness, WS employees who use firearms to conduct official duties are required to attend an approved firearms safety and use training program within 3 months of their appointment and a refresher course every 3 years afterwards (WS Directive 2.615). WS employees who carry and use firearms as a condition of employment, are required to sign a form certifying that they meet the criteria as stated in the Lautenberg Amendment which prohibits firearm possession by anyone who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Additionally, USDA runs thorough background checks on all new employees entering the agency and the Ohio WS program conducts annual firearms training for all personnel. More detailed information about shooting practices are provided in Section 2.2.4.2 and Appendix B. M-44's The M-44 (sodium cyanide ejector mechanism) is a lethal chemical control method which may be used. There has been some concern expressed by members of the public that unknown but significant risks to human health may exist from M-44's used for predator management. Currently, the M-44 device is not registered for use in the State of Ohio, but may be used if it becomes registered in the State. This chemical has been extensively researched and evaluated for registration with EPA to control canine predation on livestock and for protecting threatened and endangered species. No WS employee has ever been killed by an M-44 device in 55 years of use by WS. According to the EPA, out of greater than 400,000 recorded exposures to all types of animal toxicants, there has never been an M-44 exposure. Factors which virtually eliminate any risk of public health or safety problems from use of M-44's include: Y Follow M-44 label directions including the 26 use restrictions required by EPA and directions Y Y Y Y Y Y Y in the Predator Management Training Manual (Lowney 1996) or a similar publication. All employees using M-44's carry amyl nitrate antidote kits. Poison control centers would be notified about use of sodium cyanide in Ohio. Sodium cyanide rapidly breaks down when exposed to the environment. Because sodium cyanide rapidly breaks down when exposed to the environment, persons handling exposed dead animals would not be exposed. Sodium cyanide registered by WS has an orange marking dye which would indicate exposure of sodium cyanide if found on clothing, skin, or fur. The maximum application rates are extremely low (less than 12 grams per square mile) (see M-44 restricted use pesticide label). A human would need to orally ingest or inhale sodium cyanide from the M-44 to be harmed or die. This would mean pulling up on an M-44 embedded in the ground, the head of which is baited with rancid meat paste. The sodium cyanide would then have to be ejected into the mouth or face to receive this chemical or its metabolites into his/her system. This is highly unlikely to occur. M-44's are only used within fenced pastures and fields typically grazed by livestock. Warning signs are posted at entryways of the farm and within 25 feet of each M- 44. Property owners adjacent to the property where M-44's are to be placed would be notified. WS personnel would be certified in Ohio as restricted-use pesticide applicators. Y Y Y Y The above analysis indicates that human health risks from M-44 use would be virtually nonexistent. Livestock Protection Collars The LPC is another chemical method which may be used by WS in Ohio if it becomes registered for use in the State. Appendix B provides more detailed information on this chemical. The LPC consists of a rubber collar with two rubber reservoirs (bladders), each of which contains 15 milliliters of a 1-percent solution of sodium fluoroacetate. The LPC has Velcro straps for attachment around the neck of a sheep or goat with the reservoirs positioned just behind the jaw. Two collar sizes are available to accommodate various size livestock. Currently, the LPC is not registered for use in the State of Ohio. Coyotes typically attack sheep and goats by biting them on the throat and crushing the larynx, causing suffocation. Coyotes that attack collared sheep generally puncture the collar with their teeth (in 75% or more of attacks) and receive a lethal oral dose of toxicant. There has been limited use of LPC's in the Eastern U.S.; for example in Virginia over a 4-year period during FY 1997-1999, 1830 milliliters of sodium fluoroacetate from LPC's was exposed from puncturing by coyotes, torn by unknown causes, or lost. Factors which virtually eliminate any risks of public health or safety problems from use of LPC's include: Y The toxicant (sodium fluoroacetate) is contained within rubber bladders worn by livestock Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y which makes it unlikely the public will come into contact with LPC's. A human would need to ingest liquid toxicant from one of the rubber bladders to have any chance of receiving the chemical into his/her system, which is highly unlikely to occur. Secondary hazard studies with mammals and birds have shown that there is no hazard of secondary poisoning. Warning signs would be placed at the entrance of farms where sheep or goats collared with LPC's are located within fenced pastures. Warning labels are attached to all LPC's informing a person about the toxic nature of the contents. If legalized in Ohio, WS personnel would be certified in Ohio as restricted-use pesticide applicators who would be required to take an additional written exam before being certified as a LPC applicator. There is a yellow dye mixed with the sodium fluoroacetate in the LPC which serves as a warning that the LPC has been punctured and precautionary measures such as wearing rubber gloves need to be taken. WS personnel would follow label instructions and directions in the Predator Management Training Manual (Lowney 1996) or a similar publication. LPC devices would be checked daily to ensure proper fit and that they were unbroken. The above analysis indicates that human health risks from sodium fluoroacetate (LPC) use would be virtually nonexistent. Large Gas Cartridges Another lethal chemical which may be used or recommended by WS, if it becomes registered for use in the State, includes the Large Gas Cartridge (Sodium nitrate). The Large Gas Cartridge is placed in burrows/dens and is burned to create carbon monoxide gas to euthanize animals. Applicators must exercise caution to avoid burns to the skin or surrounding vegetation. Such chemicals must undergo rigorous testing and research to prove safety, effectiveness, and low environmental risks before they would be registered by EPA. Any operational use of chemical repellents would be in accordance with labeling requirements under FIFRA and state pesticide laws and regulations which are established to avoid unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. Following labeling requirements and use restrictions are a built-in mitigation measure that would assure that use of registered chemical products would avoid significant adverse effects on human health and safety. Currently, the Large Gas Cartridge is not registered for use in the State of Ohio. Although the section 1533.02, Part D of the ORC does not allow for the take of wildlife from its nest, house, den, or burrow; the DOW does make an exception for nuisance wild animals as stated in the Nuisance Wild Animal Regulations (OAC �1501:31-15-03, Part B(4)): "Wild animals which are causing damage and which cannot be live-trapped because of certain conditions may be killed by licensed nuisance wild animal trappers or other persons only after such trappers or other persons apply for and receive written permission from the Chief of The Division of Wildlife or his designee." Alternative 6 - No Federal WS Predator Damage Management in Ohio Private efforts to reduce or prevent damage would be expected to increase, resulting in less experienced persons implementing damage management methods and potentially leading to greater risk to human health and safety than the Proposed Action, although not to the point that they would become substantial. Individuals that are less experienced with firearms, traps and snares may not be selective when targeting predators, thus increasing the potential to injure humans. In addition, hazards to humans could be greater under this alternative if chemicals that are less selective and cause secondary poisoning are used. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to alleviate damage could lead to illegal use of certain toxicants that could pose secondary poisoning hazards to pets and to mammalian and avian scavengers. Some chemicals that could be used illegally would present greater risks of adverse effects on humans than those recommended under the Proposed Action. 4.1.5 Humaneness of Control Methods Used by WS Alternative 1 - No Action, Technical Assistance Only Under this alternative, WS would not be involved in any control methods to reduce livestock predation. Therefore, no direct impacts would be experienced by any wildlife species or population as a result of WS operational control methods. Efforts by land managers and other entities to reduce predation to livestock could increase, potentially resulting in inhumane captures or deaths of the target species and non-target species including T&E species, pets, and native wildlife. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to alleviate damage could lead to illegal use of certain toxicants that could pose secondary poisoning hazards and inhumane death or sickness to pets and to mammalian and avian scavengers. Overall negative impacts on humaneness by resource owners and other entities should be less than Alternative 6 since WS would be providing information on the humane use of control methods. Alternative 2 - Non-lethal Control Only Under this alternative, only non-lethal methods would be used or recommended by WS. If livestock producers use guard animals (a non-lethal method) recommended by WS, it is possible that guard animals may attack predators or non-target animals that are perceived as a threat and cause, by some peoples perception, an inhumane attack or death. However, because non-lethal techniques may not always stop damage to livestock from predators, efforts by land managers and other entities to reduce predation to livestock could increase, potentially resulting in inhumane captures or deaths of the target species and non-target species including T&E species, pets, and native wildlife, similar to Alternative 6. It is hypothetically possible that frustration caused by the inability to alleviate damage could also lead to illegal use of certain toxicants that could pose secondary poisoning hazards and inhumane death or sickness to pets and to mammalian and avian scavengers. Persons or groups opposed to the live capturing and restraining of animals (i.e., traps and snares) or any type of lethal control would most likely prefer this alternative to Alternatives 3, 4, or 5. Alternative 3 - Non-lethal Control Before Lethal Control Under this alternative, WS would be required to implement non-lethal methods prior to the implementation of lethal methods. WS impacts on humaneness would be similar to Alternative 2 in those cases were non-lethal methods effectively reduced predation levels to acceptable levels and would be similar to the proposed action when lethal methods were implemented by WS. However, because non-lethal control must be applied before lethal control, predation to livestock may not be reduced in a timely and effective manner. In those situations, resource owners may be unwilling to accept further losses as all available non-lethal methods are applied. This could result in resource owners rejecting WS non-lethal methods and implement their own lethal control program resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 4 - Lethal Control Only Under this alternative, WS would implement and recommend lethal control methods without applying or considering non-lethal methods to reduce predation on livestock in Ohio. Lethal methods are often applied by WS as a result of unsuccessful attempts by land managers to alleviate predator damage to their livestock through non-lethal methods. WS impacts on humaneness would be similar to the proposed action. Alternative 5 - Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (Proposed Action) Under this alternative, WS would incorporate select components from Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. WS personnel are experienced and professional in their use of management methods, and methods are applied as humanely as possible. Under this alternative, predators would be trapped as humanely as possible or shot by experienced WS personnel using the best methods available. Some persons may perceive this method as inhumane because they oppose all lethal methods of damage management. This alternative allows WS to consider non-lethal methods, and WS would implement non-lethal methods when appropriate. Alternative 6 - No Federal WS Predator Damage Management in Ohio This alternative would be considered humane by many people opposed to WS and the assistance provided. Producers may consider this alternative inhumane because of the gruesome injuries and deaths their livestock experience from predators. Resource owners could use lethal and non-lethal methods to reduce predator damage. The proper selection and most humane use of methods may not occur as persons without sufficient experience may attempt to implement damage management techniques. In addition, some resource owners may take illegal action against localized populations of predators out of frustration of continued damage. Some of these illegal actions may be less humane than methods used by experienced WS personnel. 4.1.6 Effects on the Aesthetic Values of Target and Non-target Species Alternative 1 - No Action, Technical Assistance Only Under this alternative, WS would not be involved in any direct control methods to reduce livestock predation in Ohio. Therefore, WS effects on any aesthetic values to target and non-target species would be nonexistent. Some people and/or groups who oppose any wildlife damage control by government agencies or other groups and individuals would likely support this alternative. People and/or groups who have affectionate bonds with individual animals or animals in general, would not be affected by WS activities as stated in this alternative. Conversely, large segments of the public who consume and utilize byproducts of livestock and poultry and especially those whose livelihood depends on these animals would be impacted negatively because of the continued level and potential increase in livestock predation. However, it is likely that land managers or other individuals would conduct predator management, with or without WS technical advice, where predators are killing livestock, but the extent of the effectiveness of these individuals may be limited. Overall negative impacts on aesthetic values by landowners and other entities should be less than Alternative 6 since WS would be providing technical advice and information. Alternative 2 - Non-lethal Control Only Under this alternative, only non-lethal methods would be used or recommended by WS. No impacts to the aesthetic values of target and non-target species would be expected as the direct result of WS non-lethal activities or recommendations. People and/or groups who have affectionate bonds with individual animals or animals in general, would not be affected by WS activities as stated in this alternative. Conversely, large segments of the public who consume and utilize byproducts of livestock and poultry and especially those whose livelihood depends on these animals would be impacted negatively if non-lethal methods were ineffective at reducing predation to acceptable levels. However, because non-lethal techniques may not always stop damage to livestock from predators, efforts by land managers and other entities to reduce predation to livestock could increase, resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 3 - Non-lethal Control Before Lethal Control Under this alternative, WS would implement non-lethal control methods prior to the use of lethal methods. WS impacts on aesthetic values would be similar to Alternative 2 in those cases were non-lethal methods effectively reduced predation levels to acceptable levels and would be similar to the proposed action when lethal methods were implemented by WS. However, because non-lethal control must be applied before lethal control, predation to livestock may not be reduced in a timely and effective manner. In those situations, resource owners may be unwilling to accept further losses as all available non-lethal methods are applied. This could result in resource owners rejecting WS non-lethal methods and implement their own lethal control program resulting in impacts similar to Alternative 6. Alternative 4 - Lethal Control Only Under this alternative, WS would implement and recommend lethal control methods without applying or considering non-lethal methods to reduce predation on livestock in Ohio. WS impacts on aesthetic values of predators would likely be greater under this alternative than proposed action since lethal methods would be used in all damage situations. Lethal removal of predators would occur in localized areas. In these localized areas, target species populations may be impacted in the short term; however, the impact to the species would be insignificant to the overall population in a region or statewide. Therefore, target and non-target species would remain common and abundant for hunting and viewing opportunities for the general public. Target predator species under this EA are typically secretive in nature and viewing opportunities are limited because of their habits. It may be perceived by some that WS activities may contribute to limited viewing opportunities; however, animals removed from the population will be replaced by immigrants from outlying areas in a short period of time where localized population control efforts take place. Others like to listen to coyotes and consider it important to know that they are in an area. Some individuals or groups are opposed to any killing of animals. Some do not believe that predators should be harassed or killed to stop or reduce damage problems and that predation is part of doing business as a livestock producer. Resource owners negatively affected by predation and those individuals that feel predators are negatively affecting their aesthetic values of other wildlife species would likely support this alternative since this alternative has the potential of reducing predation to acceptable levels in many situations. Alternative 5 - Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (Proposed Action) Under this alternative, WS would incorporate select components from Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. Removal of predators may occur in localized areas where lethal control activities are implemented. In these localized areas, target species populations may be impacted in the short term; however, the impact to the species would be insignificant to the overall population in a region or statewide. Therefore, target and non-target species would remain common and abundant for hunting and viewing opportunities for the general public. Target predator species under this EA are typically secretive in nature and viewing opportunities are limited because of their habits. It may be perceived by some that WS activities may contribute to limited viewing opportunities; however, animals removed from the population will be replaced by immigrants from outlying areas in a short period of time where localized population control efforts take place. Others like to listen to coyotes and consider it important to know that they are in an area. Some individuals or groups are opposed to any killing of animals, under this alternative some lethal control will occur and those individuals or groups would continue to be opposed regardless of methods used. Some do not believe that predators should be harassed or killed to stop or reduce damage problems and that predation is part of doing business as a livestock producer. Resource owners negatively affected by predation and those individuals that feel predators are negatively affecting their aesthetic values of other wildlife species would likely support this alternative. This alternative has the greatest potential of reducing predation to acceptable levels since all control methods could be considered and used under this alternative. Alternative 6 - No Federal WS Predator Damage Management in Ohio The impacts of this alternative to stakeholders would be variable depending on their values towards wildlife and compassion for their neighbors. Resource owners receiving damage from predators would likely strongly oppose this alternative because they would bear the damage caused by depredating carnivores. Animal activists and a minority of environmental activists would prefer this alternative because activists believe it is morally wrong to kill or use animals for any reason. Some people would support this alternative because they enjoy seeing predators, or having predators nearby. However, while WS would take no action under this alternative, other individuals or entities could, and likely would, conduct damage management activities. 4.2 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS No significant or cumulative adverse environmental consequences resulting from the Proposed Action are anticipated (Table 4.2). Under the Proposed Action, the lethal removal of coyotes and red foxes would not have a significant impact on overall coyote or red fox populations in Ohio, but some local reductions may occur. Control activities will not negatively impact other protected flora or fauna in Ohio. The Proposed Action is supported by the DOW, the agency responsible for managing coyotes, red foxes and other flora and fauna in the State (Appendix E). No threatened or endangered species or critical habitat would be adversely impacted by the Proposed Action. Therefore, WS with concurrence from the DOW (Appendix E) and USFWS (Appendix F), has determined that the Proposed Action would not likely adversely affect any species protected under the ESA. No risk to public safety is expected by WS activities since only trained and experienced wildlife biologists and wildlife specialists would conduct and recommend control measures for livestock losses due to predation. There is a slight increased risk to public safety when control activities are conducted by persons that reject WS assistance and recommendations, but not to the extent that they would be significant. Although some persons will likely be opposed to WS participation in control activities to protect livestock from predation, the analysis in this EA indicates that WS Integrated Wildlife Damage Management program will not result in significant cumulative adverse impacts on the quality of the human environment.

Appendix A Response to Comments to the Environmental Assessment "Management of Coyote, Red Fox, Feral Dog, Wolf-Hybrid, and Exotic Carnivore Predation on Livestock in the State of Ohio" Issue 1: A statewide EA lacks the information necessary for "site specific" analysis. Program Response 1: WS addressed this issue in Sections 1.7.4 and 2.4.2 of the EA. Issue 2: Wildlife Services (WS) control activities may have detrimental effects on wildlife abundance and diversity. Program Response 2: The impacts of the current WS program on biodiversity are not significant nationwide or statewide (USDA 1997). The goal of integrated wildlife damage management programs are to reduce damage, with some programs containing a component of reducing the local target species population. The proposed action would have no effect on biodiversity at the state and county level. Biodiversity on individual properties would likewise not be affected. Regarding predators, local areas may have lower predator densities after the project, but no area would be devoid of all predators. Habitats and ecosystems would not be negatively affected, and no secondary adverse impacts on other species would be created. In some areas, where predators are negatively impacting native wildlife species, species diversity may increase where local predator numbers are reduced. As analyzed in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.3 of the EA, WS would have no adverse effects on statewide coyote and red fox populations or other wildlife populations. Issue 3: Inadequate justification of the need for action; There is not a need to use lethal control as a means of reducing livestock predation in Ohio. Program Response 3: Lethal control is a reasonable and at times a necessary management tool used to effectively reduce livestock predation. As described in section 3.2 of the EA, lethal control is considered as part of an Integrated Wildlife Damage Management (IWDM) approach used to effectively resolve wildlife conflicts. The decision model outlined in section 3.2.3 of the EA identifies a number of relevant considerations in determining an appropriate control strategy. These factors include the regulatory framework, economic losses and costs, social acceptability, effectiveness, and others. This model allows for consideration of a broad range of factors in selection of control strategies in an effort to find an acceptable balance between human interests and wildlife needs, including both lethal and nonlethal approaches to resolving conflicts. In the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, et al. vs. Hugh Thompson, Forest Supervisor for the Dixie National Forest, et al., the United States District Court of Utah denied plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. In part, the court found that a forest supervisor need only show imminent threat of damage is probable to establish a need for wildlife damage management (U.S. District Court of Utah 1993). Issue 4: The EA is not an objective evaluation of the alternatives and their potential impacts; the draft EA fails to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Program Response 4: WS follows all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines in analyzing potential impacts of their actions, including those established by NEPA. In making an informed decision of potential environmental impacts, WS uses the best available scientific information, data and expert advise. Appendix A of the EA provides a list of 136 documents that are used and referenced throughout the EA for analyzing potential impacts of the proposed program and Chapter 5 of the EA provides a list of the persons consulted in the development of the EA. Potential impacts are systematically analyzed in Chapter 4 of the EA. Each issue is fully explained and analyzed against each alternative to allow the reader an objective way to evaluate potential outcomes of each alternative. By conducting such a systematic and objective analysis, and using the best available scientific information, data and expert advise, WS is able to make an informed decision as required by NEPA. Issue 5: WS's own research indicates that generalized killing is ineffective at reducing predation losses. Program Response 5: As stated in sections 1.2.1, 3.1.5, and 3.2 of the EA, the proposed action does not intend to conduct generalized killing throughout the state of Ohio. An integrated wildlife damage management plan utilizing education, non-lethal and lethal techniques will be used to reduce livestock losses caused by predators. Knowlton et al. (1999) states that "Various techniques can prevent or curtail predation on livestock but none are universally effective", "...removing coyotes to solve depredation problems is typically more effectively done by wildlife management personnel", and that "successful depredation management requires a variety of techniques used in an integrated program." Blejwas et al. (In Press) and Sacks et al. (1999a, 1999b) found that breeding adults whose territories contained sheep were typically responsible for the killing of livestock and that targeting those individuals for removal reduced predation to livestock. Wagner and Conover (1999) found that preventative damage management in areas of historic predation on livestock significantly reduced predation to livestock and was cost effective. Conner et al. (1998) suggested that coyote removal efforts should occur just prior to known peaks of predation. When implemented, mechanical and lethal methods used by WS will target individuals responsible for predation of livestock. Issue 6: Livestock producers should be expected to attempt to prevent predation by utilizing non-lethal/livestock husbandry techniques before requesting federal assistance. Program Response 6: WS recognizes the importance of good husbandry and management practices in helping to reduce wildlife damage. WS policy is to respond to all requests for assistance within program authority and responsibility. If improved husbandry practices would likely reduce a predation problem, WS makes recommendations regarding these practices. Although, there is no law or policy requiring livestock producers to employ good husbandry practices to protect their livestock, most Ohio livestock producers do employ a variety of husbandry practices and nonlethal damage management methods to protect their livestock as a matter of good business. Issue 7: Non-lethal control methods should be used before lethal control methods. Program Response 7: WS addressed this issue in section 3.1.3 and was fully analyzed in Chapter 4 of the EA. WS recognizes the importance of non-lethal methods as an important dimension of IWDM and non-lethal methods are considered or used first in each damage management strategy, if applicable, as described in the Proposed Alternative. These non-lethal methods are promoted through program directives, literature and in personal consultations with affected resource owners. A blanket prohibition of the use of lethal controls until nonlethal controls have been tried and found to be unsuccessful, could result in increased losses to resource owners. A major increase in expenditures, including livestock losses, could threaten the existence of some producers, particularly those with marginal operations. Issue 8: Livestock losses are compensated by the State of Ohio. Program Response 8: WS addressed this issue in Sections 3.3.1. The Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) only reimburses the livestock owner for livestock losses caused by coyotes. In addition, only livestock injuries or losses that can be confirmed by both Dog Warden and Wildlife Officer that a coyote was responsible for the loss will be reimbursed the "Fair Market Value" on the day the animal was confirmed injured or killed (Ohio Revised Code �955.51-955.53). Many losses are denied claim or not reported because: 1) of insufficient evidence as to species responsible for death, 2) claims made after 3 day reporting date from date of kill, 3) livestock found too late to identify cause of death, and 4) livestock disappear and are never located (D. Goeglein, Ohio Department of Agriculture, Reynoldsburg, Ohio, personal communication). Although wildlife damage levels may appear relatively light, when compared to the overall value of agricultural production and the losses to other causes, losses to individual producers or to groups of producers can be severe. In situations where producers were reimbursed for losses in lieu of predator control efforts, losses to coyotes were typically higher, ranging from 12-29% of lambs and 1-8% of ewes (Knowlton et al. 1999). Issue 9: The federal government spends tax dollars on the killing of wildlife; Livestock protection dollars should be used to address the causes of livestock losses and not used for livestock protection purposes. Program Response 9: Funding for WS comes from a variety of sources in addition to federal appropriations. Ohio agency funds, county funds, city funds, private funds, and other federal agency funds are applied to the program under Cooperative Agreements. Federal, state, and local officials have decided that wildlife damage management should be conducted by appropriating funds. WS was established by Congress as the agency responsible for providing wildlife damage management to the people of the United States. Wildlife damage management is an appropriate sphere of activity for government programs, since aspects of wildlife damage management are a government responsibility and authorized and directed by law. WS legislative mandate is described in section 1.8.1.1 of the EA. Issue 10: Sheep and lamb losses are compensated by the State of Ohio; there is no need to use lethal control to reduce sheep and lamb predation in Ohio. Program Response 10: See Program Response 8. WS will always recommend non-lethal management methods to producers; however, costs to the producer may be excessive or the methods impractical. Although there are reports of success with non-lethal methods, failures are common, few have been subjected to experimental tests, and none have proven universally successful (Knowlton et al. 1999). Issue 11: WS proposed livestock protection program is non-selective at removing predators that are causing livestock losses. Program Response 11: WS employees are experienced and trained to use the most selective and target specific methods available for removing depredating predators. Mitigation measures, as described in section 3.4 of the EA, ensure that only individual problem animals are removed. Furthermore, as described in section 3.2.3 of the EA, WS utilizes a decision making process (Slate et al. 1992) to select the most appropriate method to effectively resolve a particular damage situation. Each specific damage situation is carefully evaluated to ensure that only predators that are depredating or have the potential to depredate livestock are being impacted by WS activities. Issue 12: The EA lacks detailed information on specific livestock losses caused by predators in Ohio; there are no reports of domestic animals being predated by foxes, wolf-hybrids and exotic carnivores in Ohio. Program Response 12: Livestock losses caused by predators in Ohio has been reported in Section 1.2 of the EA. Although occurrences are low, fox, wolf-hybrid, and exotic carnivore predation on livestock in Ohio does occur throughout the state (E. Householder, USDA, Wildlife Services, Ohio, personal communication; T. Conant, President, Ohio Dog Wardens Association, personal communication; ODA unpublished data). Unfortunately, this data only exists in field log notebooks and in Dog Warden Reports that have not been compiled. Issue 13: The EA lacks historical information for past WS involvement in livestock predator control in Ohio. Program Response 13: WS involvement with predator control in Ohio in the past consisted of technical assistance only; therefore, WS has not taken predators or non-target species in response to livestock depredation in Ohio. As mentioned in section 1.2 of the EA WS has responded to 726 incidents of predation on livestock by coyotes (n = 716), red fox (n = 5), and feral dogs (n = 5) with technical assistance (unpublished MIS data). Issue 14: The EA should weigh the benefits and risks of using M-44's and 1080 livestock collars. Program Response 14: WS addressed this issue in Appendix B and Chapter 4 of the EA. WS personnel are aware of and are concerned about the risks of chemicals used for wildlife damage control. The Ohio WS program complies with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Only trained and certified applicators are permitted to apply restricted-use pesticides. When APHIS WS personnel use pesticides, precautions are taken to assure that these materials are used in ways that pose the least possible risk to the environment and public health and safety. APHIS WS personnel also recommend equally safe practices to private users through technical assistance activities and instruct those users to abide by applicable regulations and the EPA label instructions required by those regulations. Issue 15: The EA should be replaced by a full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Program Response 15: WS has determined that the analysis in the EA showed no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The EA took a hard look at the need for action, the issues, alternatives, and environmental consequences, and resulted in a FONSI that discussed, under each of the ten CEQ points of significance, why each was not significant. WS carefully considered all comments from respondents to the public involvement efforts. The agency followed CEQ NEPA regulations, and Agency NEPA implementing procedures. Thus, the EA resulted in a FONSI that specified why an EIS was not required. APPENDIX B: COYOTE DAMAGE MANAGEMENT METHODS AVAILABLE FOR USE OR RECOMMENDED BY THE OHIO WILDLIFE SERVICES PROGRAM PRODUCER-IMPLEMENTED NON-LETHAL METHODS These consist primarily of non-lethal preventive methods such as cultural methods and habitat modification. Cultural methods and other management techniques are implemented by the livestock producer. Livestock producers may be encouraged to use these methods, based on the level of risk, need, and professional judgment on their effectiveness and practicality. These methods include: Animal husbandry practices include modifications in the level of care or attention given to livestock (depending on the age and size of the flock or herd). Animal husbandry practices include, but are not limited to, the use of: Y Guard animals used in livestock protection are dogs, donkeys, and llamas. These animals can effectively reduce predator losses in some situations (Knowlton et al. 1999). Guard dogs most frequently used are Maremma and Great Pyrenees breeds. Anatolian shepherds and Akbash breeds may also be effective. Success in using guard dogs is highly dependent on proper breeding and bonding with the type of livestock the dog is to protect. Effective use of guard dogs depends on training, obedience, care, and feeding (Green and Woodruff 1996). The efficacy of guard dogs is affected by the amount of predation loss, size and topography of the pasture, acceptance of the dog by the livestock, training, compatibility with humans, and compatibility with other predator control methods. Guard dog breeds mature at about 2 years of age and may begin protecting livestock at this age. Guard dogs have an effective working life of less than three years because of accidents, disease, and people misidentifying the guard dog as a threat to the livestock (Lorenz et al. 1986, Green 1989). Guard dogs may kill, injure, harass, or rape sheep and goats (Green and Woodruff 1983). The success of guard dogs in other programs (e.g., Virginia) is highly variable with a few livestock producers claiming all coyote predation stopped and some livestock producers reporting no effectiveness at stopping predation. Most livestock producers report they believe there was a reduction in coyote predation. Guard llamas have also been used with mixed success to protect livestock, but are typically aggressive toward dogs and appear to readily bond with sheep (Cavalcanti and Knowlton 1998). Llamas can be kept in fenced pastures, do not require special feeding programs, are usually tractable, and have a relatively long working life compared with guard dogs (Knowlton et al. 1999). Meadows and Knowlton (2000) found llamas were able to reduce predation on sheep initially, but dogs and coyotes adapted to the protective nature of llamas over time, thus reducing their effectiveness. Guard donkeys have been used to protect livestock with mixed results. The reported most effective guard donkey is a jenny with a foal. Guard donkeys are probably more effective at deterring dog predation than coyote predation. Y Herders or shepherds stay with the flock all day and night. This method historically was used with roving bands of sheep. It is rarely used in Ohio because sheep and goats are confined to fenced pastures. Y Barn/shed lambing is birthing lambs, kids (baby goats), or calves in buildings. Lambs and goats may be born and kept in a building for the first one to two weeks of life. Cattle are rarely birthed in buildings because of cost, size, and number of buildings which would be required. Birthing in buildings adds additional labor costs and raises disease concerns among livestock producers. While this may initially enhance survival of young animals, predators may still remove young animals when they
