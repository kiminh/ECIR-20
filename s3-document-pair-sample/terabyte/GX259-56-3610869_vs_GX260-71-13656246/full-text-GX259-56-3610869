LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST SB 151, as amended, Burton. Controlled substances: Schedule II. Existing law provides that no person shall prescribe a controlled substance, nor shall any person fill, compound, or dispense such a prescription unless it complies with specified requirements, one of which is that prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances shall be prepared on triplicate prescription blanks issued by the Department of Justice. Existing law also provides for the electronic monitoring of 95 SB 151 --2-- the prescribing and dispensing of Schedule II controlled substances pursuant to the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) program, as specified. The CURES program is scheduled to become inoperative on July 1, 2008, and repealed on January 1, 2009. Existing law provides that a violation of any of these provisions is generally a misdemeanor. This bill, the Treatment and Drug Diversion Prevention Act of 2003, would, on and after July 1, 2004, eliminate the triplicate prescription requirement for Schedule II controlled substances and would, on and after January 1, 2005, require prescribers of Schedule II controlled substances to meet the same prescription requirements imposed with respect to other prescribable controlled substances, as specified. The bill would , on and after January 1, 2005, require prescriptions for any controlled substance to be issued on controlled substance prescription forms obtained from a security printer approved by the Board of Pharmacy, as specified. Between July 1, 2004, and January 1, 2005, these prescriptions would be permitted using either the triplicate form or the security forms. The bill would make the CURES program applicable to Schedule III drugs if there is adequate funding and would also provide for the indefinite continuation of the CURES program by deleting its repeal date. The bill would make it a crime to counterfeit a controlled substance prescription; knowingly possess a counterfeited controlled substance prescription; or obtain under false pretenses, or fraudulently produce, a controlled substance prescription, as specified. By creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also revise provisions relating to electronically transmitted prescriptions and would add provisions authorizing pharmacies to dispense certain prescriptions from out-of-state prescribers, as specified. The bill would make conforming changes to related provisions. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: yes. 95 --3-- SB 151 The people of the State of California do enact as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 SECTION 1.
