AREA SERIES U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census Nov. 3, 1999 MISSISSIPPI iii Introduction to the Economic Census PURPOSES AND USES OF THE ECONOMIC CENSUS The economic census is the major source of facts about the structure and functioning of the Nation's economy. It provides essential information for government, business, industry, and the general public. Title 13 of the United States Code (Sections 131, 191, and 224) directs the Census Bureau to take the economic census every 5 years, covering years ending in 2 and 7. The economic census furnishes an important part of the framework for such composite measures as the gross domestic product estimates, input/output measures, production and price indexes, and other statistical series that measure short-term changes in economic conditions. Specific uses of economic census data include the following: � Policymaking agencies of the Federal Government use the data to monitor economic activity and assess the effectiveness of policies. � State and local governments use the data to assess business activities and tax bases within their jurisdictions and to develop programs to attract business. � Trade associations study trends in their own and competing industries, which allows them to keep their members informed of market changes. � Individual businesses use the data to locate potential markets and to analyze their own production and sales performance relative to industry or area averages. ALL-NEW INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATIONS Data from the 1997 Economic Census are published primarily on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), unlike earlier censuses, which were published according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. NAICS is in the process of being adopted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Most economic census reports cover one of the following NAICS sectors: 21 22 23 31-33 42 44-45 48-49 51 Mining Utilities Construction Manufacturing Wholesale Trade Retail Trade Transportation and Warehousing Information 52 53 54 55 56 61 62 71 72 81 Finance and Insurance Real Estate and Rental and Leasing Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Management of Companies and Enterprises Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services Educational Services Health Care and Social Assistance Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation Accommodation and Foodservices Other Services (except Public Administration) (Not listed above are the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting sector (NAICS 11), partially covered by the census of agriculture conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Public Administration sector (NAICS 92), covered by the census of governments conducted by the Census Bureau.) The 20 NAICS sectors are subdivided into 96 subsectors (three-digit codes), 313 industry groups (four-digit codes), and, as implemented in the United States, 1170 industries (five- and six-digit codes). RELATIONSHIP TO SIC While many of the individual NAICS industries correspond directly to industries as defined under the SIC system, most of the higher level groupings do not. Particular care should be taken in comparing data for retail trade, wholesale trade, and manufacturing, which are sector titles used in both NAICS and SIC, but cover somewhat different groups of industries. The industry definitions discuss the relationships between NAICS and SIC industries. Where changes are significant, it will not be possible to construct time series that include data for points both before and after 1997. For 1997, data for auxiliary establishments (those functioning primarily to manage, service, or support the activities of their company's operating establishments, such as a central administrative office or warehouse) will not be included in the sector-specific reports. These data will be published separately. GEOGRAPHIC AREA CODING Accurate and complete information on the physical location of each establishment is required to tabulate the census data for the states, metropolitan areas (MAs), counties, parishes, and corporate municipalities including cities, towns, villages, and boroughs. Respondents were INTRODUCTION 1 1997 ECONOMIC CENSUS U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census required to report their physical location (street address, municipality, county, and state) if it differed from their mailing address. For establishments not surveyed by mail (and those single-establishment companies that did not provide acceptable information on physical location), location information from Internal Revenue Service tax forms is used as a basis for coding. BASIS OF REPORTING The economic census is conducted on an establishment basis. A company operating at more than one location is required to file a separate report for each store, factory, shop, or other location. Each establishment is assigned a separate industry classification based on its primary activity and not that of its parent company. DOLLAR VALUES All dollar values presented are expressed in current dollars; i.e., 1997 data are expressed in 1997 dollars, and 1992 data, in 1992 dollars. Consequently, when making comparisons with prior years, users of the data should consider the changes in prices that have occurred. All dollar values are shown in thousands of dollars. AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL DATA Reports in Print and Electronic Media All results of the 1997 Economic Census are available on the Census Bureau Internet site (www.census.gov) and on compact discs (CD-ROM) for sale by the Census Bureau. Unlike previous censuses, only selected highlights are published in printed reports. For more information, including a description of electronic and printed reports being issued, see the Internet site, or write to U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20233-8300, or call Customer Services at 301-457-4100. Special Tabulations Special tabulations of data collected in the 1997 Economic Census may be obtained, depending on availability of time and personnel, in electronic or tabular form. The data will be summaries subject to the same rules prohibiting disclosure of confidential information (including name, address, kind of business, or other data for individual business establishments or companies) that govern the regular publications. Special tabulations are prepared on a cost basis. A request for a cost estimate, as well as exact specifications on the type and format of the data to be provided, should be directed to the Chief of the division named below, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20233-8300. To discuss a special tabulation before submitting specifications, call the appropriate division: 2 INTRODUCTION Manufacturing and Construction Division Service Sector Statistics Division HISTORICAL INFORMATION 301-457-4673 301-457-2668 The economic census has been taken as an integrated program at 5-year intervals since 1967 and before that for 1954, 1958, and 1963. Prior to that time, individual components of the economic census were taken separately at varying intervals. The economic census traces its beginnings to the 1810 Decennial Census, when questions on manufacturing were included with those for population. Coverage of economic activities was expanded for the 1840 Decennial Census and subsequent censuses to include mining and some commercial activities. The 1905 Manufactures Census was the first time a census was taken apart from the regular decennial population census. Censuses covering retail and wholesale trade and construction industries were added in 1930, as were some covering service trades in 1933. Censuses of construction, manufacturing, and the other business service censuses were suspended during World War II. The 1954 Economic Census was the first census to be fully integrated: providing comparable census data across economic sectors, using consistent time periods, concepts, definitions, classifications, and reporting units. It was the first census to be taken by mail, using lists of firms provided by the administrative records of other Federal agencies. Since 1963, administrative records also have been used to provide basic statistics for very small firms, reducing or eliminating the need to send them census questionnaires. The range of industries covered in the economic censuses expanded between 1967 and 1992. The census of construction industries began on a regular basis in 1967, and the scope of service industries, introduced in 1933, was broadened in 1967, 1977, and 1987. While a few transportation industries were covered as early as 1963, it was not until 1992 that the census broadened to include all of transportation, communications, and utilities. Also new for 1992 was coverage of financial, insurance, and real estate industries. With these additions, the economic census and the separate census of governments and census of agriculture collectively covered roughly 98 percent of all economic activity. Printed statistical reports from the 1992 and earlier censuses provide historical figures for the study of longterm time series and are available in some large libraries. All of the census reports printed since 1967 are still available for sale on microfiche from the Census Bureau. CD-ROMs issued from the 1987 and 1992 Economic Censuses contain databases including nearly all data published in print, plus additional statistics, such as ZIP Code statistics, published only on CD-ROM. 1997 ECONOMIC CENSUS U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census SOURCES FOR MORE INFORMATION More information about the scope, coverage, classification system, data items, and publications for each of the economic censuses and related surveys is published in the Guide to the 1997 Economic Census and Related Statistics at www.census.gov/econguide.

This sector comprises (1) establishments that are involved in producing, promoting, or participating in live performances, events, or exhibits intended for public viewing; (2) establishments that preserve and exhibit objects and sites of historical, cultural, or educational interest; and (3) establishments that operate facilities or provide services that enable patrons to participate in recreational activities or pursue amusement, hobby, and leisure time interests. Some establishments that provide cultural, entertainment, or recreational facilities and services are classified in other sectors. Excluded from this sector are: (1) establishments that provide both accommodations and recreational facilities, such as hunting and fishing camps and resort and casino hotels are classified in Subsector 721, Accommodation; (2) restaurants and night clubs that provide live entertainment in addition to the sale of food and beverages are classified in Subsector 722, Foodservices and Drinking Places; (3) motion picture theaters, libraries and archives, and publishers of newspapers, magazines, books, periodicals, and computer software are classified in Sector 51, Information; and (4) establishments using transportation equipment to provide recreational and entertainment services, such as those operating sightseeing buses, dinner cruises, or helicopter rides are classified in Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation. Data for this sector are shown for establishments of firms subject to Federal income tax and separately of firms which are exempt from Federal income tax under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Many of the ``kinds of business or operation'' included in this sector are not thought of as commercial businesses and the terms (such as ``business,'' ``establishment,'' and ``firm'') used to describe them may not be descriptive of such services. However, these terms are applied to all ``kinds of business or operation'' in order to maintain conformity in the measures of the production and delivery of goods and services and in the presentation of data. The basic tabulations for this sector do not include data for establishments which are auxiliary (primary function is providing a service, such as warehousing or bookkeeping) to service establishments within the same organization. Data for auxiliaries are presented separately. 1997 ECONOMIC CENSUS U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census GENERAL A list of reports that provide statistics on sector 71 follows. Geographic area reports. There is a separate report for each state, the District of Columbia, and the United States. For establishments of firms subject to Federal income tax, each state report presents general statistics on number of establishments, receipts, payroll, and employment by kind of business for the state, metropolitan areas (MAs), counties, and places with 2,500 inhabitants or more. Greater kind-of-business detail is shown for larger areas. For establishments of firms exempt from Federal income tax, each state report presents statistics on number of establishments, revenue, expenses, payroll, and employment by kind of business, for the state and MAs. Greater kindof-business detail is shown for larger areas. The United States report presents data for the United States as a whole for establishments with payroll of firms subject to Federal income tax, as well as those exempt from Federal income tax, for detailed kind-of-business classifications. Sources of receipts or revenue report. This report presents sources of receipts or revenue data for establishments with payroll by kind of business. Data are presented for the United States and states. Establishment and firm size (including legal form of organization) report. This report presents receipts/revenue, payroll, and employment data for the United States by receipts/revenue size, by employment size, and by legal form of organization for establishments; and receipts/revenue size (including concentration by largest firms), by employment size, and by number of establishments operated (single units and multiunits) for firms. Miscellaneous subjects report. This report presents data for establishments with payroll for a variety of industry-specific questions. Presentation of data varies by kind of business. ZIP Code report. This report presents data for establishments with payroll by United States ZIP Code. GEOGRAPHIC AREAS COVERED The level of geographic detail varies by report. Data may be presented for: ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND RECREATION 5 1. The United States as a whole. 2. States and the District of Columbia. 3. Consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSAs) and primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as of June 30, 1997. A CMSA is an area used to facilitate the presentation and analysis of data for large concentrations of metropolitan populations. It includes two or more contiguous PMSAs which have a population of at least 1,000,000 (according to the 1990 Census of Population or subsequent special census) and which meet specific criteria of urban character and of social and economic integration. 4. Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) defined by the OMB as of June 30, 1997. An MSA is an integrated economic and social unit with a population nucleus of at least 50,000 inhabitants (according to the 1990 Census of Population or subsequent special census). Each MSA consists of one or more counties meeting standards of metropolitan character. In New England, cities and towns rather than counties are the component geographic units. 5. Areas within the state outside metropolitan areas (MAs). 6. Counties and county equivalents defined as of January 1, 1997. Counties are the primary divisions of states, except in Louisiana where they are called parishes and in Alaska where they are called boroughs and census areas. Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia have one place or more that is independent of any county organization and constitutes primary divisions of their states. These places are treated as counties and as places. 7. Consolidated cities defined as of January 1, 1997. Consolidated cities are consolidated governments which consist of separately incorporated municipalities. 8. Municipalities of 2,500 inhabitants or more defined as of January 1, 1997. These are areas of significant population incorporated as cities, boroughs, villages, or towns according to the 1990 Census of Population or subsequent special census. For the economic census, boroughs and census areas in Alaska and boroughs in New York are not included in this category. 9. Special economic urban areas (SEUAs), which include townships in Michigan, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and towns in New York, Wisconsin, and the six New England states with 10,000 inhabitants or more (according to the 1990 Census of Population or subsequent special census). COMPARABILITY OF THE 1992 AND 1997 CENSUSES The 1997 Economic Census is the first census to present data based on the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Previous census data were presented according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system developed some 60 years ago. Due to this change, comparability between census years may be limited. Comparative statistics will be included as part of the Core Business Statistics Reports. DISCLOSURE In accordance with Federal law governing census reports (Title 13 of the United States Code), no data are published that would disclose the operations of an individual establishment or business. However, the number of establishments in a kind-of-business classification is not considered a disclosure; therefore, this information may be released even though other information is withheld. AVAILABILITY OF MORE FREQUENT ECONOMIC DATA The Census Bureau conducts the Service Annual Survey (SAS) each year. This survey, while providing more frequent observations, yields less kind-of-business and geographic detail than the economic census. In addition, the County Business Patterns program offers annual statistics on the number of establishments, employment, and payroll classified by industry within each county. 6 ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND RECREATION 1997 ECONOMIC CENSUS U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census Table 1a.

AREA SERIES U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census Nov. 3, 1999 MISSISSIPPI 25 Appendix A. Explanation of Terms ANNUAL PAYROLL Payroll includes all forms of compensation, such as salaries, wages, commissions, dismissal pay, bonuses, vacation allowances, sick-leave pay, and employee contributions to qualified pension plans paid during the year to all employees. Also included are tips and gratuities received by employees from patrons and reported to employers and the value of payments in kind (e.g., free meals and lodging). If an employee works at more than one location, the payroll is included in the one location where they spend most of their time. Also included are salaries of professional service organizations or associations which operate under state professional corporation statutes and file a corporate Federal income tax return. Excluded are payrolls of departments or concessions operated by other companies at the establishment. For corporations, payroll includes amounts paid to officers and executives; for unincorporated businesses, it does not include profit or other compensation of proprietors or partners. Payroll is reported before deductions for social security, income tax, insurance, union dues, etc. This definition of payroll is the same as that used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on Form 941. EXPENSES ($1,000) Includes program service grants, specified assistance to individuals, benefits paid to or for members, payroll, employee benefits, payroll taxes, interest and rent expenses, cost of supplies used for operation, cost of merchandise sold, depreciation expenses, fundraising expenses, contracted or purchased services, and other expenses charged to operations during 1997. Expenses exclude outlays for the purchase of real estate; construction and all other capital improvements; funds invested; assessments or dues paid to the parent or other chapters of the same organization; incomes taxes; sales and other taxes collected directly from customers or clients and paid directly to a local, state, or Federal tax agency; and, for fundraising organizations, funds transferred to charities and other organizations. FIRST-QUARTER PAYROLL ($1,000) Represents payroll paid to persons employed at any time during the quarter January to March 1997. NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted and/or services are provided. It is not necessarily identical with a company or enterprise, ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND RECREATION U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census which may consist of one establishment or more. Economic census figures represent a summary of reports for individual establishments rather than companies. For cases where a census report was received, separate information was obtained for each location where business was conducted. When administrative records of other Federal agencies were used instead of a census report, no information was available on the number of locations operated. Each economic census establishment was tabulated according to the physical location at which the business was conducted. The count of establishments represents those in business at any time during 1997. When two activities or more were carried on at a single location under a single ownership, all activities generally were grouped together as a single establishment. The entire establishment was classified on the basis of its major activity and all data for it were included in that classification. However, when distinct and separate economic activities (for which different industry classification codes were appropriate) were conducted at a single location under a single ownership, separate establishment reports for each of the different activities were obtained in the census. An establishment is included in the census if it is an employer, the establishment has $1,000 in payroll, and was in operation at any time during 1997. Leased service departments (separately owned businesses operated as departments or concessions of other service establishments or of retail businesses, such as a separately owned shoeshine parlor in a barber shop, or a beauty shop in a department store) are treated as separate service establishments for census purposes. Leased retail departments located in service establishments (e.g., a gift shop located in a hotel) are considered separate retail establishments. NUMBER OF PAID EMPLOYEES FOR PAY PERIOD INCLUDING MARCH 12 Paid employees consists of full-time and part-time employees, including salaried officers and executives of corporations, who were on the payroll during the pay period including March 12. Included are employees on paid sick leave, paid holidays, and paid vacations; and members of a professional service organization or association which operates under state professional corporation statutes and files a corporate Federal income tax return. Not included are proprietors and partners of unincorporated businesses, and employees of departments or concessions operated by other companies at the establishment. The definition of paid employees is the same as that used on IRS Form 941. APPENDIX A A�1 RECEIPTS/REVENUE ($1,000) Receipts (basic dollar volume measure for service establishments of firms subject to Federal income tax). Includes receipts from customers or clients for services rendered, from the use of facilities, and from merchandise sold during 1997 whether or not payment was received in 1997. For advertising agencies, travel industries, and other service establishments operating on a commission basis, receipts include commissions, fees, and other operating income, NOT gross billings and sales. Excise taxes on gasoline, liquor, tobacco, etc., which are paid by the manufacturer or wholesaler and passed on in the cost of goods purchased by the service establishment, are also included. The establishments share of receipts from departments, concessions, and vending and amusement machines operated by others are included as part of receipts. Receipts also include the total value of service contracts, market value of compensation received in lieu of cash, amounts received for work subcontracted to others, and dues and assessments from members and affiliates. Receipts from services provided to foreign customers from U.S. locations, including services preformed for foreign parent firms, subsidiaries, and branches are included. Receipts are net after deductions for refunds and allowances for merchandise returned by customers. Receipts do not include sales, occupancy, admissions, or other taxes collected from customers and remitted directly by the firm to a local, state, or Federal tax agency, nor do they include income from such sources as contributions, gifts, and grants; dividends, interest, and investments; or sale or rental of real estate. Also excluded are receipts (gross) of departments and concessions which are operated by others; sales of used equipment rented or leased to customers; domestic intracompany transfers; receipts of foreign subsidiaries; and other nonoperating income, such as royalties, franchise fees, etc. Receipts do not include service receipts of manufacturers, wholesalers, retail establishments, or other businesses whose primary activity is other than service. They do, however, include receipts other than from services rendered (e.g., sale of merchandise to individuals or other businesses) by establishments primarily engaged in performing services and classified in the service industries. Revenue (basic dollar volume measure for firms exempt from Federal income tax). Includes revenue from customers or clients for services rendered and merchandise sold during 1997, whether or not payment was received in 1997, and gross sales of merchandise, minus returns and allowances. Also included are income from interest, dividends, gross rents (including display space rentals and share of receipts from departments operated by other companies), gross contributions, gifts, grants (whether or not restricted for use in operations), royalties, dues and assessments from members and affiliates, commissions earned from the sale of merchandise owned by others (including commissions from vending machine operators), and gross receipts from fundraising activities. Receipts from taxable business activities of firms exempt from Federal income tax (unrelated business income) are also included in revenue. Revenue does not include sales, admissions, or other taxes collected by the organization from customers or clients and paid directly to a local, state, or Federal tax agency; income from the sale of real estate, investments, or other assets (except inventory held for resale); gross receipts of departments, concessions, etc., that are operated by others; and amounts transferred to operating funds from capital or reserve funds. SALES, RECEIPTS, OR REVENUE ESTIMATED (PERCENT) Percent of total sales/receipts/revenue that was imputed based on historic company ratios or administrative records, or on industry averages. SALES, RECEIPTS, OR REVENUE FROM ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS (PERCENT) Percent of total sales/receipts/revenue obtained from administrative records of other Federal agencies. A�2 APPENDIX A ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND RECREATION U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census Appendix B. NAICS Codes, Titles, and Descriptions 71 ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND RECREATION The Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation sector includes a wide range of establishments that operate facilities or provide services to meet varied cultural, entertainment, and recreational interests of their patrons. This sector comprises (1) establishments that are involved in producing, promoting, or participating in live performances, events, or exhibits intended for public viewing; (2) establishments that preserve and exhibit objects and sites of historical, cultural, or educational interest; and (3) establishments that operate facilities or provide services that enable patrons to participate in recreational activities or pursue amusement, hobby, and leisure time interests. Some establishments that provide cultural, entertainment, or recreational facilities and services are classified in other sectors. Excluded from this sector are: (1) establishments that provide both accommodations and recreational facilities, such as hunting and fishing camps and resort and casino hotels are classified in Subsector 721, Accommodation; (2) restaurants and night clubs that provide live entertainment in addition to the sale of food and beverages are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places; (3) motion picture theaters, libraries and archives, and publishers of newspapers, magazines, books, periodicals, and computer software are classified in Sector 51, Information; and (4) establishments using transportation equipment to provide recreational and entertainment services, such as those operating sightseeing buses, dinner cruises, or helicopter rides are classified in Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation. 711 Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries Industries in the Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector group establishments that produce or organize and promote live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, athletes, and other entertainers, including independent (i.e., freelance) entertainers and the establishments that manage their careers. The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1) producing (i.e., presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and representing entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative and technical skills necessary to the production of ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND RECREATION U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census these live events. Also, this subsector contains four industries for performing arts companies. Each is defined on the basis of the particular skills of the entertainers involved in the presentations. The industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and performing artists (i.e., independent or freelance). Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a particularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector. Distinguishing this activity from the production activity is a meaningful process differentiation. This approach, however, is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists, especially pop groups. These establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from freelancers. For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists. This subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do not. This is because there are significant differences in cost structures between those promoters that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and those that do not. In addition to promoters without facilities other industries in this subsector include establishments that may operate without permanent facilities. These types of establishments include: performing arts companies, musical groups and artists, spectator sports, and independent (i.e., freelance) artists, writers, and performers. Excluded from this subsector are nightclubs. Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a regular basis and it can be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events with Facilities. However, since most of these establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not promote entertainment and because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places. 7111 Performing Arts Companies This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in producing live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, and other performing artists. APPENDIX B B�1 71111 Theater Companies and Dinner Theaters This industry comprises (1) companies, groups, or theaters primarily engaged in producing the following live theatrical presentations: musicals; operas; plays; and comedy, improvisational, mime, and puppet shows and (2) establishments, commonly known as dinner theaters, engaged in producing live theatrical productions and in providing food and beverages for consumption on the premises. Theater groups or companies may or may not operate their own theater or other facility for staging their shows. 711110 Theater Companies and Dinner Theaters This industry comprises (1) companies, groups, or theaters primarily engaged in producing the following live theatrical presentations: musicals; operas; plays; and comedy, improvisational, mime, and puppet shows and (2) establishments, commonly known as dinner theaters, engaged in producing live theatrical productions and in providing food and beverages for consumption on the premises. Theater groups or companies may or may not operate their own theater or other facility for staging their shows. The data published with NAICS code 711110 are comprised of these parts of the following SIC industries: 5812 (pt) Dinner Theaters 7922 (pt) Opera Companies 7922 (pt) Theater Companies 7111101 Opera Companies Establishments primarily engaged in producing operas. 7111102 Theater Companies Establishments primarily engaged in producing live theatrical presentations, such as musicals, plays, and puppet and mime shows. Theater groups or companies may or may not operate their own theater or other facility for staging their shows. 7111103 Dinner Theaters Establishments primarily engaged in producing live theoretical productions and in providing food and beverages for consumption on the premises. 71112 Dance Companies This industry comprises companies, groups, or theaters primarily engaged in producing all types of live theatrical dance (e.g., ballet, contemporary dance, folk dance) presentations. Dance companies or groups may or may not operate their own theater or other facility for staging their shows.

B�10 APPENDIX B ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND RECREATION U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census Appendix C. Coverage and Methodology MAIL/NONMAIL UNIVERSE For this sector, large- and medium-size firms, plus all firms known to operate more than one establishment, were sent questionnaires to be completed and returned to the Census Bureau by mail. For most very small firms, data from existing administrative records of other Federal agencies were used instead. These records provided basic information on location, kind of business, receipts, payroll, number of employees, and legal form of organization. Firms in the 1997 Economic Census were divided into the mail universe and nonmail universe. The coverage of and the method of obtaining census information from each are described below: 1. The mail universe consisted of firms for which information was obtained by means of a mail canvass and included: a. Large employers, i.e., all multiestablishment firms, and all employer firms with payroll above a specified cutoff (The term ``employers'' refers to firms with one or more paid employees at any time during 1997 as shown in the active administrative records of other Federal agencies.). b. A sample of small employers, i.e., singleestablishment firms with payroll below a specified cutoff, in classifications for which specialized data precluded reliance solely on administrative records sources. 2. The nonmail universe consisted of firms that were not required to file a regular census return and included: a. Selected small employers, i.e., single-establishment firms with payroll below a specified cutoff. Although the payroll cutoff varied by kind of business, small employers in the nonmail universe generally included firms with less than 10 employees and represented about 10 percent of total receipts of establishments covered in the census. Data on receipts, payroll, and employment for small employers in the nonmail universe were derived or estimated from administrative records of other Federal agencies. b. All taxable nonemployers, i.e., all firms subject to Federal income tax with no paid employees during 1997. Receipts information for these firms was obtained from administrative records of other Federal agencies. Although consisting of many firms, ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND RECREATION U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 Economic Census nonemployers accounted for less than 10-percent of total receipts of all establishments covered in the census. The census included only those nonemployer firms which reported a receipts volume of $1,000 or more during 1997. Establishments exempt from Federal income tax with no paid employees were excluded as in previous censuses. Data for nonemployers are not included in this report, but are released as part of the ``Core Business Statistics Series.'' INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION OF ESTABLISHMENTS The classifications for all establishments in this sector were assigned in accordance with the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Manual, United States. NAICS is a common classification system developed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This system replaces the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) that was used in previous censuses. Appendix A of the 1997 NAICS manual provides information on the comparability between the 1987 SIC and the 1997 NAICS. More information on NAICS is available in the NAICS manual and at www.census.gov/naics. The method of assigning classifications, and the level of detail at which establishments were classified, differed between the mail and nonmail universe as follows: 1. The mail universe. Establishments in the mail universe were classified on the basis of their self-designation, sources of receipts, and other industry-specific inquiries. 2. The nonmail universe. a. Selected small employers were classified on the basis of the most current kind-of-business classification available from one of the Census Bureau's current sample surveys or the 1992 Economic Census. Otherwise, the classification was obtained from administrative records of other Federal agencies. If the census or administrative record classifications proved inadequate (none corresponded to a 1997 Economic Census classification in the detail required for employers), the firm was sent a brief inquiry requesting information necessary to assign a 1997 census kind-of-business code. b. Nonemployers were classified on the basis of information obtained from administrative records of other Federal agencies. APPENDIX C C�1 METHOD OF ASSIGNING TAX STATUS For kind-of-business classifications where there were substantial numbers of taxable and tax-exempt establishments, establishments were classified based on the Federal income tax filing requirement for the establishment or organization. This classification was based primarily on the response to an inquiry on the census questionnaire. Establishments that indicated that all or part of their income was exempt from Federal income tax under provisions of section 501 of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code were classified as tax-exempt; establishments indicating no such exemption were classified as taxable. All government-operated hospitals were classified as taxexempt. For establishments in the nonmail universe, the tax status classification was based upon the type of tax return filed by the firm or organization. For selected kind-of-business classifications that are comprised primarily of tax-exempt establishments, all establishments in those classifications were defined as tax-exempt. All establishments in the remaining kind-ofbusiness classifications (comprised primarily of taxable establishments) were defined as taxable. RELIABILITY OF DATA All data compiled for this sector are subject to nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors can be attributed to many sources: inability to identify all cases in the actual universe; definition and classification difficulties; differences in the interpretation of questions; errors in recording or coding the data obtained; and other errors of collection, response, coverage, processing, and estimation for missing or misreported data. Data presented in the Miscellaneous Subjects and the Sources of Receipt or Revenue reports for this sector are subject to sampling errors as well as nonsampling errors. Specifically, these data are estimated based on information obtained from census questionnaires mailed to all large employers and to a sample of small employers in the universe. Sampling errors affect these estimates insofar as they may differ from results that would be obtained from a complete enumeration. The accuracy of these tabulated data is determined by the joint effects of the various nonsampling errors or by the joint effects of sampling and nonsampling errors. No direct measurement of these effects has been obtained except for estimation for missing or misreported data; however, precautionary steps were taken in all phases of the collection, processing, and tabulation of the data in an effort to minimize the effects of nonsampling errors. The Census Bureau obtains limited information extracted from administrative records of other Federal agencies. This information is used in conjunction with other information available to the Census Bureau to develop estimates for nonemployers, small employers, and other establishments for which responses were not received in time for publication. TREATMENT OF NONRESPONSE Census report forms included two different types of inquiries, ``basic'' and ``industry-specific.'' Data for the basic inquiries, which include location, kind of business or operation, receipts or revenue, payroll, number of employees, and legal form of organization, were available from a combination of sources for all establishments. Data for industry-specific inquiries, tailored to the particular kinds of business or operation covered by the report, were available only from the establishments in the mail universe that completed the appropriate inquiries on the questionnaire. Data for industry-specific inquiries in this sector were expanded in most cases to account for establishments that did not respond to the particular inquiry for which data are presented. Data presented for industry-specific inquiries based on a December 31 reference date were expanded in direct relationship to total receipts or revenue of only those establishments in business at the end of the year. Unless otherwise noted in specific reports, data for other industry-specific inquiries were expanded in direct relationship to total receipts or revenue of all establishments included in the category. In a few cases expansion on the basis of the receipts or revenue item was not appropriate, and another basic data item was used as the basis for expansion of reported data to account for nonrespondents. All reports in which data were expanded to account for nonmail employers and nonrespondents include a coverage indicator for each publication category, which shows the receipts or revenue of establishments responding to the industry-specific inquiry as a percent of total receipts or revenue for all establishments for which data are shown. For some inquiries, coverage is determined by the ratio of total payroll or employment of establishments responding to the inquiry to total payroll or employment of all establishments in the category.
