Sorry!

We currently have about 15 enrolled (which is a good number for this
class), but if there is someone else who desparately needs to get into this
class, follow directions below.

==================
This is the first of several classes offered by the OSW for training on
acoustic profilers in FY2001.  A schedule of classes for the rest of the
fiscal year will be posted to the OSW acoustics support pages
(http://il.water.usgs.gov/adcp/) shortly.

=====================================================
Measurement of Streamflow Using ADCP's
December 4-8, 2000

Announcement

A training course on streamflow measurement using acoustic Doppler current
profilers (ADCP's) will be held December 4-8, 2000 in Louisville, KY at the
Kentucky District office.  This class has been prepared for the purpose of
training personnel in the application of ADCP's as per OSW memo 96.02,
which provides U.S. Geological Survey policy on the use of ADCP's.

Description

This 5-day class will provide an introduction to the use of ADCP's for
streamflow measurement.  The course will combine lectures and "hand's-on"
use of ADCP's for collecting streamflow.  The course will require some pre-
and post-class work by each student.  The pre-class work will consist of
reading assignments and one exercise that must be completed prior to the
class.  Post-class work will consist of collecting data using an ADCP and
having that data reviewed by a certified USGS ADCP instructor.

The emphasis of this course will be on the practical aspects of using
ADCP's for streamflow measurements.  Some of the topics that will be
covered during the course include (1) basic principles of ADCP operation,
(2) configuration files, (3) ADCP expert commands, (4) basic procedures for
streamflow measurement, (5) using PLAYBACK to review ADCP measurements and
compute discharge, and (6) trouble-shooting problems encountered in the
field.  We will cover profilers made by RD Instruments and, time
permitting, Sontek.

Attendees

This class is designed for personnel who need training on the application
of ADCP's for streamflow measurement.  The Office of Surface Water policy
on the use of ADCP's currently requires that ADCP operators receive
training.  It is important that the attendees be current ADCP users or
intend using the ADCP within 1-2 months of taking the class.  Attendance
will be limited to approximately 16 students.  Priority will be given to
USGS Districts who currently own, or are purchasing an ADCP.  Requests from
cooperators to attend the class will be considered if space is available.

Requirements

In order to attend the class, attendees must complete pre-class activities,
including reading assignments and one exercise.  In addition, prior to
coming to the class, each attendee must load software used in the class and
verify that it will work on the laptop they will be using during the
class.  Finally, each student must commit to making at least 2 discharge
measurements within 2 months of completing the class and having those
measurements successfully reviewed by a USGS ADCP instructor.

Each attendee should bring field clothes and a laptop computer for use in
collecting ADCP data.  In addition, it is expected that each attendee will
have basic PC computer skills.  This includes rudimentary knowledge of how
to use Windows programs, edit files with a text editor, etc.

The laptop to be used in the class should minimally have a 200 MHz Pentium
processor and 32 megabytes of RAM.  A machine with a faster processor speed
and more memory is desirable.  In addition, the laptop should be suitable
for field use.

Cost

The tuition for the class will be approximately $750 for USGS
employees.  The final tuition will be determined based on the number of
instructors needed for the class, the number of attendees, and the actual
class costs.  The tuition is used to pay for instructor time and travel,
preparation of training materials, equipment used in the class, etc.  In
order to be nominated for the class, USGS personnel are required to submit
an account number that will be used to initiate an SV for those selected to
attend the class.  Non-USGS personnel who wish to attend the class will
have to pay approximately $1,500, because of USGS regulations which require
overhead to be assessed for class expenses for personnel from other agencies.

Accommodations

The class will be held in Louisville, KY at the Kentucky District
office.  A block of rooms has been reserved at the Best Western Signature
Inn for Dec 3-8.  The cutoff for reservations is Nov. 27. The reservations
are under "U.S. Geological Survey".  The confirmation number is
127327.  Room rates are $63 per night.  Telephone number to hotel is (502)
267-8100.  Once accepted to the class, each trainee will be notified and
should call and make their own individual room reservations.  Additional
information concerning accommodations and/or ground transportation will be
transmitted to the attendees prior to the class.
