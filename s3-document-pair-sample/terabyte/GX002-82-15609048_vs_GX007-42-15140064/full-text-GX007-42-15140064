License Issue Date Online Date License Expiration Date 506 3,962,616 89.4 % BWR February 28, 1973 Nov. 30, 1972 March 21, 2012 BWR= Boiling Water Reactor Description:� The plant is on a 125-acre site at Vernon, Vermont, in Windham County.� Typically, Vermont Yankee provides 80 percent of the electricity for the entire State.� In 2001, the unit averaged a capacity factor over 90 percent (94.1 percent), enabling the power plant to produce 4.17 billion kwh of electricity.� Vermont Yankee is owned and operated by the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation. Sources: Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, "Annual Electric Generator Report." Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
