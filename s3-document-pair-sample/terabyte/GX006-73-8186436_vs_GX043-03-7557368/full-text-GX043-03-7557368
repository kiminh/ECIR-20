License Issue Date Online Date License Expiration Date �980 �8,468,718 �98.7 % �BWR �Nov. 20, 1985 �June 16, 1986 �August 29, 2025 BWR= Boiling Water Reactor Description:� The River Bend station is on a 3,300-acre site in West Feliciana near the State Capitol. In 2001, the reactor operated at better than 90 percent capacity (95.1 percent) to produce 7.80 billion kilowatthours of electricity. River Bend is operated by Entergy Nuclear and owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. Sources: Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, "Annual Electric Generator Report." Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
