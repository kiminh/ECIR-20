License Issue Date Online Date License Expiration Date 758 6,318,151 95.2 % BWR Jan. 18, 1974 Jul 1, 1974 Jan. 18, 2014 BWR= Boiling Water Reactor Description:� Cooper Nuclear Station occupies a 1,251-acre site in Brownsville, Nebraska. In 2001, the reactor had a capacity factor of 78.4 percent and supplied 5.21 billion kilowatthours of electricity.� The plant is completely owned by the Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD).� Sources: Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, "Annual Electric Generator Report." Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
