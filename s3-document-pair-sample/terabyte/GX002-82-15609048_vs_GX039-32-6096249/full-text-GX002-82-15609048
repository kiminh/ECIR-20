In 2001, unit 1 generated 9.99 billion kilowatthours of electricity while averaging 99.3 percent of capacity utilization.� The other unit averaged 95.5 percent while generating 9.61 billion kwh of electricity.� The Southern Nuclear Operating Co. operates the plant.�� The reactors have multi-ownership as follows:� Georgia Power Co. (45.7 percent), Oglethorpe Power Corp. (30 percent), Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (22.7 percent), and the Dalton Water & Light Sinking Fund Commission (1.6 percent). Sources: Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, “Annual Electric Generator Report.” Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA’s Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
