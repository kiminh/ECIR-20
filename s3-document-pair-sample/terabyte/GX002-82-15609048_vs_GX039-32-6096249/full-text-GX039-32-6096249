License Issue Date Online Date License Expiration Date R 1,231 10,059,470 93.3 % BWR October 1, 1984  July 1, 1985 November 1, 2024 R= Revised BWR= Boiling Water Reactor Note: The Grand Gulf reactor was up rated in capacity from the previously reported total, 1,210 net MW(e). Description:��The Grand Gulf nuclear station lies on a 2,100-acre site near Vicksburg.� The site is wooded and contains two lakes.� The plant has a 520-foot cooling tower.� In 2001, the plant generated 9.92 billion kilowatthours of electricity and achieved a 93.6 percent average annual capacity factor.� Grand Gulf is operated by Entergy Nuclear and owned jointly by System Energy Resources, Inc., (90 percent) and by South Mississippi Electric Power Association (10 percent). Sources: Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, "Annual Electric Generator Report." Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
