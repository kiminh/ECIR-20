1                      PANEL PROCEEDINGS

2              (The meeting was called to order at 8:50

3   a.m., Wednesday, October 17, 2001.

4   MS. ANDERSON:  Good morning and welcome,

5   Committee chairperson, members and guests.  I am

6   Janet Anderson, Executive Secretary of the Executive

7   Committee of the Medicare Coverage Advisory

8   Committee, known as MCAC.

9   The Committee is here today to discuss and

10   vote upon the findings of the Diagnostic Imaging

11   Panel regarding the diagnosing and staging of breast

12   cancer using Positron Emission Tomography scanning

13   technology, or PET; discuss and vote upon the

14   findings of the Drugs, Biologics and Therapeutics

15   Panel regarding the use of levocarnitine injections

16   for end-stage renal disease patients.

17   The following announcement addresses

18   conflict of address issues associated with this

19   meeting and is made part of the record to preclude

20   even the appearance of impropriety.  The conflict of

21   interest statute prohibits special government

22   employees from participating in matters that could

23   affect their or their employer's financial interests.

24   To determine if any conflict existed, the Agency

25   reviewed all financial interests reported by the

00007

1   Committee participants.  The Agency has determined

2   that all members may participate in the matters

3   before the Committee today.

4   With respect to all other participants, we

5   ask that in the interest of fairness that all persons

6   making statements or presentations disclose any

7   current or previous financial involvement with any

8   firm whose products or services they may wish to

9   comment on.  This includes direct financial

10   investments, consulting fees, and significant

11   institutional support.

12   And now I would like to turn the meeting

13   over to Dr. Sean Tunis and then to Chairman

14   Dr. Harold Sox who will ask the Committee members to

15   introduce themselves and to disclose for the record

16   any involvement with the topics to be presented

17   today.

18   DR. TUNIS:  Thanks, Janet.  I just wanted

19   to briefly welcome all of the Executive Committee

20   members as well as the guests who are attending.

21   Executive Committee members, we really appreciate

22   your willingness to come to each of these meetings

23   and provide your input, feedback and advice.

24   The only thing I wanted to mention, the

25   question has been asked to me again today whether

00008

1   this is the last time the Executive Committee will be

2   considering the recommendations made by a panel on a

3   specific coverage issue, and as I mentioned in the

4   past, the BIPA law passed last year, Benefits

5   Improvement and Protection Act, did go into effect

6   October 1st, or some pieces of it, and one part of

7   that legislation was intended to remove the

8   ratification function from the Executive Committee.

9   There were some minor drafting problems in that

10   legislation which makes it unclear as to whether in

11   fact your ratification function has been removed and

12   we're working on clarifying that language, so for the

13   time being, there is one scheduled panel meeting

14   coming up before the next Executive Committee, that's

15   I believe January 10th, the Diagnostic Imaging Panel

16   will be meeting to talk about use of PET for

17   Alzheimer's disease or suspected dementia, and the

18   Executive Committee will be meeting again after that

19   and whether or not you do or don't ratify or consider

20   ratifying that recommendation will depend on what

21   happens in terms of technical corrections for the

22   legislation.  So I hope that is extremely clear, you

23   either will or you won't.

24   DR. BERGTHOLD:  Yeah.  If we do, will it

25   make it better?

00009

1   DR. TUNIS:  So with that, I'd like to hand

2   the meeting over to Dr. Sox and we will proceed with

3   the business.

4   DR. SOX:  Thank you very much.  We have I

5   think a fairly straightforward agenda today and look

6   forward to the discussion this afternoon about a

7   number of unrelated items about how we as the

8   Executive Committee function.

9   I would like to start off by asking each

10   of the members to introduce themselves, and if you

11   have had any prior engagement with questions that

12   we're going to be discussing, and that could be

13   either financial conflict or it could be simply an

14   intellectual engagement if you've written an

15   editorial or something like that on the subject, I

16   think we need to hear that, and conceivably but

17   probably not recuse you from voting on the basis of

18   that.  So please be sure to let us know not only

19   about your potential financial conflicts, but also

20   any intellectual conflict.

21   So, with that as introduction, Joe, could

22   you start by introducing yourself?

23   DR. JOHNSON:  Joe Johnson, Paxson,

24   Florida, private practice chiropractic, no conflict.

25   DR. MCNEIL:  Barbara McNeil, Harvard

00010

1   Medical School Health Policy and Radiology.  I'm a

2   member of the Blue Cross TEC panel which reviewed the

3   original assessment on PET and breast cancer.

4   DR. MAVES:  Mike Maves, Consumer

5   Healthcare Products Association.  No conflicts.

6   MS. RICHNER:  Randel Richner, Boston

7   Scientific.  No conflicts.

8   DR. FERGUSON:  John Ferguson, consultation

9   in healthcare.  No conflicts.

10   MS. BERGTHOLD:  Linda Bergthold, consumer

11   representative.  No conflicts.

12   DR. SOX:  Just before Dr. Aubry introduces

13   himself, I would like to introduce him as the newest

14   member of the Executive Committee, now the vice chair

15   of one of the panels, and by virtue of that is a

16   member of the Executive Committee, so welcome, Wade.

17   DR. AUBRY:  Thank you.  I'm Wade Aubry

18   from the University of California at San Francisco,

19   and I am vice chair of the Medical Devices Panel.  I

20   was formerly the chairman of the Blue Cross/Blue

21   Shield Association's TEC medical advisory panel which

22   reviewed PET in the past.  Otherwise, no conflicts.

23   DR. FRANCIS:  Leslie Francis.  I am in the

24   law school and philosophy department at the

25   University of Utah and I have no conflict or prior

00011

1   engagements.

2   DR. HOLOHAN:  Dr. Tom Holohan.  I am chief

3   of patient care services for the Veterans Health

4   Administration.  No conflict.

5   DR. GARBER:  Alan Garber, with the

6   Department of Veterans Affairs and Stanford

7   University.  I also serve on the Blue Cross/Blue

8   Shield Association's medical advisory panel and have

9   reviewed PET in that context.  I have also written

10   about PET when used for myocardial perfusion imaging.

11   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  Daisy Alford-Smith,

12   director of the Summit County Department of Human

13   Services in Ohio, and I have no conflict.

14   DR. MURRAY:  Bob Murray, Advocate

15   Healthcare in Chicago.  No conflicts.

16   DR. SOX:  I'm Hal Sox, editor of Annals of

17   Internal Medicine, no conflict or prior engagements.

18   So, with that we will begin and we're

19   going to hear first from the imaging panel, and

20   Barbara, are you going to present in Frank's absence?

21   DR. MCNEIL:  I am, thank you.

22   DR. SOX:  Good.

23   DR. MCNEIL:  Sox.  As Hal mentioned, I am

24   standing in Frank's shoes here and he has a summary

25   which he prepared, but what I would like to do is do

00012

1   it a little bit differently and actually present a

2   quick number of slides to make it easier as we go

3   along to show you the things that we addressed, as

4   well our results.  I would encourage you not to try

5   to match up the language I'm using with the slides,

6   because they are slightly different, but the content

7   is the same.

8   What we are going to be discussing here

9   are our deliberations on PET for the diagnosis and

10   staging of breast cancer.  When I give you the

11   results on the subsequent slides, they were all

12   unanimous except for one, and I will tell you about

13   that when we get there.

14   On June 19th we heard a presentation of

15   the Blue Cross/Blue Shield TEC assessment by a staff

16   member of the association.  We had scheduled

17   commentary from three individuals shown here.  We had

18   open comment from several individuals shown here, and

19   they were either representatives of consumer

20   organizations, currently practicing, or representing

21   themselves or their field.

22   And in the course of the day we had a

23   considerable amount of interaction back and forth

24   between the panel and the commentators.  It is

25   important to note that following the scheduled

00013

1   presentation, scheduled commentary, there was

2   considerable interaction back and forth.

3   So, I'm going to run through the questions

4   that we addressed, and you have the full report, I am

5   not going to go through all the data, that would take

6   up all day, so I'm going to give you the questions,

7   the results, and one or two pieces of data that led

8   to our decision.

9   So the first question was, is there

10   adequate evidence that PET can improve health

11   outcomes when used to decide whether to perform a

12   biopsy in patients with an abnormal mammogram or

13   palpable mass, and the issues here were very

14   straightforward.  There were 13 studies and the

15   decisions came down to two parts.  One is, the data

16   did not extrapolate for individuals who had a low

17   probability of having a malignant mass, and therefore

18   it was not possible to use the published data to make

19   a decision regarding the low probability individuals.

20   And then on the other side of the coin, the false

21   negative rate of the associated studies was high

22   enough that it precluded the use of this procedure

23   for patients with a high suspicion lesion.  So, we

24   voted negative unanimously.

25   The next question was, could PET be

00014

1   helpful in determining which patients should be

2   biopsied right away versus which patients should be

3   followed up.  So the question is, is there adequate

4   evidence that PET can improve health outcomes by

5   leading to an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of

6   breast cancer compared to a short-term follow-up in

7   patients with low suspicion lesions?  And the answer

8   here was quite clear, there were no data.  And when I

9   say no data, I mean no convincing scientific data;

10   there may have been a case report or two, but there

11   was nothing significant.

12   The next question had to do with a very

13   important one and that involved whether PET improves

14   health outcomes with regard to the decision to

15   perform axillary node dissection, since this is a

16   very important triage point in decisions regarding

17   treatment for these patients.  And here the data came

18   down as follows:  There was a meta-analysis of

19   studies that showed that the true positive rate

20   across all the studies in the field was about 80

21   percent, and the true negative rate was 89 percent,

22   with a false positive or negative of about 11

23   percent.

24   And looking at the typical prevalences of

25   disease positive nodes, prior possibility of having

00015

1   diseased nodes in these patients, it is quite clear

2   that with those sensitivities and specificities,

3   there would be a high risk of undertreating patients

4   with positive nodes using PET as a triage modality,

5   so again, this was voted down unanimously.

6   Next we moved to this question, is there

7   adequate evidence that PET improves health outcomes

8   as either an adjunct to or replacement for standard

9   staging tests in looking for locoregional recurrence

10   or distant metastases.  And when we looked at that

11   question, we really thought that the question as

12   written lumped two concepts that we had a hard time

13   dealing with.  And in the course of the deliberations

14   within the panel and the discussion of those who

15   commented on the analysis and some guest analysis, we

16   decided to split the question into two parts.

17   So we first considered whether PET could

18   be used in following up patients after they had been

19   diagnosed and after they had been treated for breast

20   cancer, and use PET as a replacement for standard

21   imaging modalities looking for disease recurrence,

22   and we again concluded that there were no data, so

23   that resulted in a negative vote.

24   Another question came up, well, what about

25   as an adjunct, suppose there is a patient with breast

00016

1   cancer and the physician is looking for recurrent

2   disease after treatment, and is quite sure or is

3   reasonably certain that there is recurrent disease,

4   what about PET as an adjunct to existing modalities

5   when that decision needs to be made.  This one

6   generated quite a lot of discussion, I would say at

7   least an hour, and the results of the deliberation

8   shown there is we voted affirmatively with one

9   abstention.

10   And the reason for the vote is shown here.

11   We had two published studies in which the data were

12   adequate to show that PET could be used as an adjunct

13   to existing modalities.  That's basically the all

14   else fails approach.  The committee felt as a result

15   of the discussion that PET might be helpful in this

16   particular clinical situation and therefore, had this

17   split vote.  It was a very close call, throughout the

18   discussion, and clearly the vote could have gone

19   either way to be honest, as indicated by the one

20   abstention, which could have been a negative vote, so

21   I want you to understand that it was a close call.

22   And then the final question was what about

23   using PET to evaluate tumor response to different

24   kinds of chemotherapeutic agents so that the

25   referring clinician would know whether to continue

00017

1   the patient on that particular modality of therapy or

2   to stop it and to switch to something else.

3   Obviously in that kind of situation, the

4   characteristics of the synergy modality have to be

5   quite good because patients are either going to stop

6   or get switched.

7   And we all agreed that it was probably, of

8   all of the things that we talked about, the most

9   promising and important aspect of the use of PET from

10   a clinical perspective, but the data were really

11   missing and they were missing from three

12   perspectives.  First, the studies are inadequate.

13   Secondly, old, and old in the sense, not that they

14   were published in the 1930s, if just that they could

15   have been published recently but with

16   chemotherapeutic agents that are irrelevant because

17   they are no longer used, so in that regard it was not

18   possible to consider them.  And the third reason we

19   gave for our decision was the fact that the

20   longitudinal follow-up of the patients wasn't

21   complete, so that patients dropped in and out and

22   therefore, it was never clear what the denominator

23   was for establishing specificity.  Our bottom line

24   was because of those three indications and because of

25   the preliminary data from these inadequate, old and

00018

1   poor studies, even with those caveats, that there

2   would be a fair amount of risk of undertreating

3   patients or withdrawing them from therapy when that

4   should have been continued.

5   So our request is that you ratify these

6   recommendations made by the Diagnostic Imaging Panel.

7   That's it, I will be happy to take any

8   questions.

9   DR. SOX:  We will proceed now to scheduled

10   public comment and will give anybody in the room a

11   chance to stand up and comment, and then the panel

12   has a good long period of time to discuss these

13   recommendations before taking a vote.  I believe we

14   have one scheduled speaker, and if you could identify

15   yourself and let us know who you work for.

16   DR. CONTE:  My name is Peter Conte,

17   associate professor of radiology --

18   DR. SOX:  And if you have any conflicts or

19   prior engagements to report, I hope you will do that.

20   DR. CONTE:  Peter Conte, associate

21   professor of radiology at University of Southern

22   California.  I have been federally sponsored as well

23   as sponsored by the public and private sector firms

24   for conducting research in the area of PET technology

25   as well as clinical applications, so those are my

00019

1   broad conflicts.

2   Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the

3   Executive Committee, and ladies and gentlemen of the

4   community.  On June 19th I appeared on behalf of the

5   Society of Nuclear Medicine and the American College

6   of Radiology, representing a combined membership of

7   over 42,000 professionals dedicated to providing high

8   quality diagnostic and therapeutics services, and

9   made a presentation to the Diagnostic Imaging Panel

10   on the utilization of PET in breast cancer, and that

11   is available as an attachment.

12   The presentation focused on new studies

13   that were to be presented the following week at SNM's

14   annual meeting in Toronto, Canada.  At that time SNM

15   and ACR urged the panel to approve the use of PET at

16   the discretion of the referring physician in the

17   diagnosis of known or suspected recurrent or

18   metastatic disease for purpose of restaging patients

19   with breast cancer.  After due deliberation, the

20   Diagnostic Imaging Panel voted affirmatively in

21   response to the following question:  Is there

22   adequate evidence that PET improves health outcomes

23   as an adjunct to standard staging tests in detecting

24   locoregional recurrence or distant metastases in

25   recurrence when results from other tests are

00020

1   inconclusive.  That's available in the minutes of the

2   June 19th meeting and as you just heard.

3   Today as we enter the next phase of

4   discussions, the positions of the ACR and the Society

5   of Nuclear Medicine remain unchanged on this issue.

6   We trust that this committee will agree with our

7   professional constituency as well as the decision

8   reached by your Diagnostic Imaging Panel and

9   recommend Medicare coverage of this PET indication.

10   Now speaking as a member of the PET

11   community at large, I would like to make reference to

12   a recently published article that appeared in the

13   September 2001 issue of the Journal of Nuclear

14   Medicine, which I believe demonstrates our ongoing

15   commitment to provide timely and relevant clinical

16   data supporting the role of PET in the breast cancer

17   population.  A recurring question -- and by the way,

18   this should not mean, we are not requesting an

19   extension of what we have done, we're just requesting

20   that you listen to what our commitment is at this

21   point.

22   A recurrent question during panel

23   discussion on June 19th was whether the result of the

24   PET scans change patient management.  In this recent

25   article, it was reported that a PET scan changed

00021

1   clinical management of 60 percent of women with

2   recurrent breast cancer.  It also changed the cancer

3   staging of 36 percent of those scanned, and that's

4   also available as an attachment in your packets.

5   The study author, Johannes Churn from

6   UCLA, found that results from 50 patients with breast

7   cancer were reported by 32 different physicians in

8   this survey.  Clinical management changes, including

9   moving from one type of treatment to another, for

10   example from surgery to radiation therapy, or medical

11   treatment to no treatment, other changes were within

12   the existing treatment, changing from one kind of

13   chemotherapy to another.  The impact of the PET scan

14   results was also significant on disease staging.

15   More than a quarter, 28 percent were upstaged and 8

16   percent were downstaged.  Before the scan, 36 percent

17   of patients were reported as having Stage IV cancer;

18   after the scan, more than 52 percent were at this

19   level as a result of finding previously undetected

20   metastasis.

21   These results reinforce the importance of

22   PET in making treatment decisions for women with

23   recurrent breast cancer.  Better treatment decisions

24   should mean longer and better quality of life for

25   those suffering from this disease.  It seems

00022

1   particularly appropriate that during October 2001,

2   National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Executive

3   Committee of the Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee

4   is presented with the opportunity to recommend

5   coverage for FDG positron emission tomography for

6   breast cancer.  I again urge you support the specific

7   decision made by the Diagnostic Imaging Panel this

8   past June.  I thank you for your attention and your

9   thoughtful consideration.

10   DR. SOX:  Thank you very much.  Are there

11   any questions that the panel members would like to

12   address to the speaker?

13   Barbara, maybe I could ask you if you

14   could try to put what you reported, particularly this

15   more recent study that I gather you didn't have a

16   chance to review, into context for us.

17   DR. MCNEIL:  Well, it does make me feel a

18   little bit like a slouch, because I didn't read my

19   September JNM yet, so I haven't actually read this

20   article, so I really can't comment without reading

21   the article, Hal, I don't think that would be right.

22   I think it's not inconsistent with the

23   recommendation that we made as an adjunct to, but I

24   would not feel on the basis of what is written here

25   that it should influence our decisions on the other

00023

1   recommendations at this point.

2   DR. SOX:  It sounds like if anything, it's

3   going to push us more toward an affirmative vote on

4   the recurrent issue, but it's also true that we

5   haven't had a chance to review the article and decide

6   whether the evidence in it justifies the conclusion

7   the authors do.

8   DR. MCNEIL:  Actually, I think that's an

9   important point and I meant to make it during my

10   remarks.  During our deliberations in June, there

11   were several other indications, or there was at least

12   one other indication that was brought before the

13   committee that was a possible question that we should

14   have been addressing, and it involved the potential

15   use of PET scanning for patients with dense breasts

16   in whom the diagnosis of cancer is sometimes very

17   difficult to make, and there was information

18   presented by several people in the audience, mostly

19   Dr. Gambhir from UCLA, who indicated that he thought

20   that just intuitively, this would be the right thing

21   to do, or a reasonable thing to do.

22   And the committee spent a long long time

23   talking about whether we should make decisions on the

24   basis of what hypothetically or theoretically might

25   seem like a reasonable thing to do in the absence of

00024

1   any underlying data to support that decision, so we

2   made the decision that we should not do that.  And I

3   think if this supports the decision that we made, and

4   I don't see any reason that it takes away from it,

5   then I think we should go with our recommendations.

6   DR. SOX:  One thing that the panel might

7   want to discuss more procedural than anything else is

8   its response to a report which starts moving us in

9   the direction of better evidence but really stands in

10   isolation, and what the proper response is under

11   those circumstances.  But I suggest we put that

12   discussion off until we get into the panel discussion

13   part of this presentation.  So, any other comments?

14   John.

15   DR. FERGUSON:  Just that the question was

16   posed is improving outcomes, and as I understand

17   Dr. Conte, the article says changing management.  And

18   I would just comment that changing management is not

19   the same thing as improved outcomes.

20   DR. SOX:  Very good reminder.

21   DR. FRANCIS:  I just have a question.  I

22   want to be sure I understand the logic.  If PET is

23   used as an extra way to diagnose somebody with dense

24   breasts when some other diagnosis isn't doing it,

25   that's sort of logically like the way you separated

00025

1   the questions on recurrence, right?  And I wanted to

2   ask you whether anybody had raised the question of

3   separating the question on initial diagnosis just as

4   you did on diagnosis of recurrences.

5   DR. SOX:  While Barbara is thinking about

6   her answer to that, I just remind the panel members,

7   please use the microphone so that everybody in the

8   room can hear you easily.

9   DR. MCNEIL:  The answer, Leslie, to that

10   is no, because the original question dealt with a

11   patient who had something on a mammogram, so the idea

12   of PET would be to separate out the false positives

13   from the true positives on the basis of the

14   mammogram.  The issue of PET as a screening modality

15   basically came from the blue without any relationship

16   to any of these questions, and I don't think it can

17   be properly insinuated as part of these questions.

18   DR. SOX:  Okay.  Alan, do you want to

19   raise an issue related to the scheduled public

20   presentation or is this more for the general

21   discussion period?

22   DR. GARBER:  I'm just hoping we can get

23   Barbara's slides back up for the general discussion.

24   DR. SOX:  Yeah, we can.  Let's try to stay

25   on responses to the scheduled public presentation.

00026

1   MS. BERGTHOLD:  I wanted to ask Dr. Conte

2   whether the phrase at the discretion of the referring

3   physician has any particular meaning.  I don't see it

4   anywhere else and it does appear in his testimony,

5   and whether he was suggesting that, what does that

6   mean basically?  Tell us a little more about that.

7   DR. CONTE:  Well, that's actually not --

8   that's what we requested earlier, but that's not the

9   final language as you saw it that was shown on the

10   slide.  The final language does not include that

11   phrase, so that's not what you're considering.  But

12   our intention at that time was that we would have the

13   ability for the referring physician to interact with

14   the radiologist and nuclear medicine physician to

15   make an individual treatment decision on a particular

16   patient, so that there would be a need to do an

17   additional test because there was some issue in that

18   particular patient.

19   DR. SOX:  Well, if there are no more

20   comments, then we will go on to the second part,

21   which is unscheduled open public comments.  And do

22   you wish to, and again, please identify yourself and

23   state any relationships you might have that we ought

24   to know about in order to interpret your comments

25   correctly.

00027

1   DR. ADLER:  My name is Lee Adler.  I'm at

2   Fox Chase Cancer Center and an officer on the Board

3   of the Academy of Molecular Imaging, which was

4   formerly known as the Institute for Clinical PET,

5   which is the original petitioner to the former HCFA

6   for this indication, and I am representing the AMI in

7   making the statement that the AMI supports the

8   positive recommendation of the advisory panel last

9   June to support the use of PET as an adjunct to

10   conventional imaging in the evaluation of possible

11   breast cancer recurrence.

12   I believe brevity is a virtue, so that's

13   my statement.

14   DR. SOX:  Thank you.  Please.

15   DR. WAHL:  I'm Richard Wahl, I'm director

16   of nuclear medicine at Johns Hopkins, and I'm in the

17   neighborhood.  I'm also a member of the Academy of

18   Molecular Imaging and past president of that

19   organization, currently a member of the ACRS&M,

20   consultant to a number of, well, at least honorarium

21   from Siemens, who makes PET scanners, and GE who

22   makes PET scanners, as well as PET-Net, who makes

23   pharmaceuticals.  The PET facility at Hopkins is part

24   of nuclear medicine.  I have written a book on PET

25   and received royalties from that, and I think those

00028

1   are my major conflicts.

2   I wanted to just offer my personal support

3   and also reiterate that of the AMI on the

4   recommendation of the Diagnostic Imaging Panel from

5   June 19th.  I had an opportunity to participate with

6   that.  I believe that the vote on the approved area

7   was that it would be helpful, not that it might be

8   helpful, and I think Barbara said might be helpful,

9   and perhaps I misrecollected, but clearly that was a

10   positive.

11   And I just wanted to mention that I had

12   recently authored an article which just came out,

13   actually came out in July, in Seminars in

14   Roentgenology, it's called Current Status of PET in

15   Breast Cancer Imaging, Staging and Therapy, and it's

16   my review of the PET literature and it basically

17   comes to a very similar conclusion as did the panel,

18   and I have this available if anybody on the committee

19   would like it, so I would encourage you to support

20   the recommendation.  Thank you.

21   DR. SOX:  Good to hear from both of you,

22   thank you very much.  Would anybody else who's here

23   like to comment before we go into committee

24   discussion node?  Any last chances to raise issues

25   that you would like us to discuss?

00029

1   In that case, we will now go into

2   committee discussion mode, and I think we will in the

3   interest of trying to be very open in this meeting,

4   if people in the audience would like to put in their

5   two dollars worth of comments as we get going, we

6   will be happy to welcome that, try to stay as

7   informal as we can without totally degenerating into

8   an unstructured discussion.

9   So, Alan, could we first ask that

10   Dr. McNeil's Power Point presentation --

11   DR. GARBER:  Actually, from my question,

12   Daisy pointed out we have a copy of the slides in our

13   folders, so it's not essential, but I don't know the

14   slide number, but it's the one that has the rephrased

15   question on adjunct use.  It says, is there adequate

16   evidence that PET improves health outcomes as an

17   adjunct, et cetera, affirmative.  And then your next

18   slide has adjunct data, two published studies,

19   inadequate data.  Discussions suggest that when all

20   else fails, this might be helpful.

21   Now, I'm a little -- I'm not questioning

22   the conclusion, but I am, I guess I am questioning

23   whether you can answer that yes, there is adequate

24   evidence when you also claim that there is inadequate

25   data.  How did the committee reconcile these, getting

00030

1   to that conclusion, to that question when you also

2   seem to have concluded there was inadequate data?

3   DR. MCNEIL:  Alan, we had a terrible time.

4   I mean realistically, it was one of the most

5   difficult discussions I have ever been part of in

6   trying to reach a conclusion that seemed to be

7   reasonable.  And in my mind there is no question that

8   the data as presented to us and as written in the

9   evidence report do not support this, they just are

10   not there.

11   DR. SOX:  Some of us were hoping the

12   slides were going to remind us exactly what we're

13   talking about.

14   DR. MCNEIL:  Janet, could you put up, try

15   number eight or nine.

16   So these two studies basically don't do it

17   realistically they don't do it, and in the course of

18   the discussion, Dr. Wahl in particular brought up

19   data that he had discussed in the article that he has

20   passed around, and there were several clinicians

21   there as well, and I actually can't remember who they

22   are now, who suggested that this was a when all else

23   fails approach, and that there were likely situations

24   in which patients would be worked up with everything

25   else that was available in which the suspicion of

00031

1   recurrent disease was high and therefore, PET might

2   be useful in those circumstances, might or would, I'm

3   not sure of which, but that it might be useful.

4   But it was one of our most difficult

5   questions and it was one of the ones that was least

6   crisply defined in terms of the data, so I don't

7   know, Alan.  If we were to be making the decisions on

8   the basis of the published data alone, it would be

9   no, there is no question it would be no.  I think we

10   gave a little slack to the situation and maybe we

11   shouldn't have, I don't know.

12   DR. SOX:  Let me focus on that if I can

13   for a second.  You said in patients where suspicion

14   is fairly high, so if you didn't have a test, then

15   you would do some direct approach like biopsy or --

16   DR. MCNEIL:  If you knew where to biopsy,

17   I think that was the idea.  For recurrent disease you

18   don't necessarily have any idea where to biopsy.

19   DR. SOX:  But in patients where suspicion

20   is high, high pretest probability, that's where

21   diagnostic tests face the greatest challenge, because

22   they have to have an extremely low false negative

23   rate in order to, in order for a negative result to

24   lower the probability of disease enough so that you

25   could be confident you could sort of watch and wait,

00032

1   and you know, often a test with a sensitivity of 95

2   percent or better won't do it with a high pretest

3   probability.  Is there any reason to expect that the

4   sensitivity of the test under these circumstances

5   could be that high?

6   DR. MCNEIL:  I don't know.

7   DR. SOX:  Would you care to make a

8   comment, Dr. Conte?

9   DR. CONTE:  Actually I would.  I would

10   like to make reference to an article by Peter

11   Hathaway actually that discussed the issue of MR

12   imaging of the axilla versus PET in patients with

13   suspected recurrent disease, and I think it directly

14   addresses this type of issue.  And it was a small

15   study, albeit 10 patients, but 50 percent of those

16   patients had an equivocal MRI examination, but 100

17   percent of the lesions were detected on PET.  So it's

18   a good example of showing you where an inconclusive

19   test such as an MRI to detect patients with suspected

20   locorecurrence had failed and the use of an adjunct

21   imaging test such as PET could come in, localize the

22   lesion and then proceed on with the rest of the

23   allegory, for example biopsy or surgical resection.

24   So I think there is some data to support

25   exactly the type of scenario that's being described.

00033

1   DR. SOX:  So in these patients where the

2   MRI was equivocal and PET identified a lesion, do

3   these patients in fact have a cancer?

4   DR. CONTE:  Yes, these were all surgical

5   or biopsy proven.  This is a small study, and you may

6   have reviewed this in your original --

7   DR. MCNEIL:  Yeah, actually, thank you,

8   Peter.  I had forgotten that that was one of the key

9   examples that the audience brought to our attention.

10   It was brought to us by Bahs Alavi from Penn, who

11   talked about this clinical situation where there

12   might be recurrence in the axilla and MR or CT,

13   probably more likely MR were negative, and PET had

14   turned out to be positive.  I actually believe that

15   has been the experience of the Farber in Boston.  But

16   again, this information is not well documented.

17   DR. SOX:  It's again, a very small study,

18   therefore, very wide confidence intervals on the

19   estimate of sensitivity and a fairly high probability

20   that the sensitivity could be considerably lower.

21   DR. MCNEIL:  I think what Bahs was talking

22   about was fewer than 15 patients, something like

23   that.

24   DR. SOX:  So if there were a hundred

25   patients and the sensitivity was still 100 percent,

00034

1   you would have much narrower confidence intervals and

2   be much more confident that a negative test meant

3   that nothing was there.  Yes, please.

4   DR. WAHL:  Richard Wahl again, from Johns

5   Hopkins.  Being at the June meeting, I remember one

6   of the things we did discuss was the difficult

7   situation of the patient who had had breast cancer

8   and had had radiation therapy to the superclavicular

9   and axillary region, and those are very difficult to

10   examine on clinical examination and MR exams are very

11   difficult because there's often gadolinium

12   enhancement due to the radiation effects.  In telling

13   -- those patients often have pain and can have

14   weakness in the arm, and it's very hard to tell if

15   they have recurrent breast cancer or if they have

16   just radiation damage to the nerves.

17   And PET, there were three articles

18   referenced in that review I gave you, references 55,

19   56 and 57, all relatively small articles, but all

20   showing the same thing, one of them being our

21   experience, that PET is much more reliable than

22   contrast MR in determining if this tumor has recurred

23   or not in that setting.  Otherwise, you're stuck in a

24   situation where the surgeon has to do blind biopsies

25   of areas of MR enhancement which are often not

00035

1   clearly due to tumor.  So the MR is probably 50

2   percent accurate in that setting.

3   These are small series, I agree, the

4   confidence intervals are wide, but a lot of groups

5   have seen this and I think several groups made the

6   same comment at the meeting, and these settings in

7   the soft tissues, especially after treatment, it can

8   be exceedingly difficult to tell what's going on by

9   standard diagnostic methods.  Standard diagnostic

10   methods work best when the anatomy is not altered.  I

11   mean, they look for symmetry and they look for normal

12   tissue planes, but as soon as you have altered tissue

13   planes, altered anatomy and altered contrast

14   enhancement due to radiation, then you have all kinds

15   of problems with standard imaging methods, and I

16   think that's where PET really excels in those

17   difficult cases, at least in our experience.

18   DR. SOX:  Thank you.  Daisy, were you --

19   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  Yes, I did have a

20   question.  I am having some difficulty following and

21   understanding the panel's recommendations,

22   particularly if you use the slide that is currently

23   there where you are recommending, or at least you

24   voted in the affirmative with the understanding that

25   there was a connection in improving health outcomes

00036

1   as an adjunct, when in fact it could not be used or

2   seen as an adjunct just in determining whether to

3   perform a biopsy.

4   DR. MCNEIL:  I'm not exactly sure what

5   your question is.  Could you just rephrase it?

6   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  It appears to me that

7   by voting in the affirmative on this particular one

8   negates the negative that you voted on the previous

9   ones, because it appears that it could be used at any

10   time as an adjunct.

11   DR. MCNEIL:  Well, the previous one was,

12   just to be clear, if I can be clear about what we

13   were talking about was if a patient is suspected of

14   having recurrent disease now with breast cancer, that

15   individual can get a bone scan if the pain is in the

16   bone, or perhaps an MR if they think it's likely, or

17   CT recurrent in the soft tissues, they would get one

18   of those tests, depending upon where the physician

19   feels the disease has likely recurred.  So this would

20   be using PET as a replacement for.

21   And when we looked at the data that lined

22   up patients who had CT, MR, bone scans and PET, or

23   some combination of those in looking for recurrent

24   disease, we couldn't really tease out from the data

25   that PET had made a contribution that was positive in

00037

1   looking for recurrent disease over and above that

2   which was seen by the imaging modalities alone, or in

3   particular pairs.  So that in our view was a

4   clear-cut negative, a clear-cut negative vote, the

5   data just weren't there.

6   This one, if anything, if we were to being

7   doing anything, we would say that the negative there

8   made this a negative, rather than the positive here

9   made that a positive.  So, I don't know if that's

10   what you're saying.

11   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  That's exactly what I'm

12   saying.

13   DR. MCNEIL:  Okay.  So you're basically

14   going pack to Alan's point that the negative vote on

15   the replacement is absolutely clear, it's negative,

16   there are no data to suggest that it can replace the

17   other modalities.  This one was, you've done them,

18   you have this scarred neck or scarred axilla,

19   patient's got arm pain, that was the example that was

20   actually presented, and you just don't know why the

21   patient has arm pain.  And the MR as I recall in the

22   case that was presented was kind of a mess because of

23   the previous radiation therapy and they just couldn't

24   see anything.  So in that particular situation,

25   nothing was working, and that's what we meant by

00038

1   adjunct to in a unique situation.

2   DR. SOX:  I think -- I'm not sure who was

3   next, but why don't you go ahead, Leslie?

4   DR. FRANCIS:  I just wanted to ask, in the

5   argument there for why it changes patient management

6   is not just a false negative versus false positive

7   question but if PET shows you where to go, PET

8   contributes additional information when you have a

9   false negative on the one test.

10   DR. MCNEIL:  Right.  Now here you're

11   getting way beyond my knowledge of the management of

12   patients with recurrent breast cancer, way beyond,

13   but I think the idea was if you actually found out,

14   if it lit up in the axilla or the neck, you would

15   know exactly where to go to biopsy, you'd do the

16   biopsy and you'd find out it wasn't fibrosis, which

17   was one possibility, but it was actually recurrent

18   cancer.  Somehow or other that triggers a treatment

19   decision, and it's clearly not more radiation

20   therapy, they have probably maxed out there, but it

21   would be some kind of chemotherapy that they would

22   try, I don't know the decision tree for the treatment

23   there.

24   DR. SOX:  Alan?  Oh, before we go on, I

25   would like a late arrival, Dr. Brook, and Bob, could

00039

1   you introduce yourself, state your affiliation and

2   state any conflicts or prior engagements you might

3   have had on the issues that we're going to be talking

4   about carnitine deficiency in end-stage renal disease

5   and PET for breast cancer.

6   DR. BROOK:  Robert Brook from Rand at

7   UCLA.  The only conflict that I know about is that my

8   mother, who was on Medicare, was referred to a PET

9   scan for breast cancer, so that's the only conflict I

10   have and I don't think that disqualifies me.

11   DR. SOX:  Thank you.  Sean, please?

12   DR. TUNIS:  I just wanted to also mention

13   for the committee that I just noticed walk in the

14   room, we do have a card carrying oncologist, Ellen

15   Feigal has joined us, she's somewhere in the

16   audience, she's going to be speaking later.  So if

17   you have some questions about management of breast

18   cancer and want to ask a real oncologist, she's

19   probably not the only one in the room, but at least

20   she is here and I am announcing to her, now available

21   for consultation.

22   (Laughter.)

23   DR. SOX:  The doctor is in.  Alan.

24   DR. GARBER:  Well, Barbara, if I might

25   take a little liberty with the language here, it

00040

1   seems to me that your panel would have felt

2   comfortable, and correct me if I'm wrong, answering a

3   question, does it appear likely that PET improves

4   health outcomes as an adjunct?  What you said in the

5   next slide about the inadequate data, notwithstanding

6   the other data we've heard about now, the panel had

7   concluded, they wouldn't have had to struggle with

8   this if they thought the data were adequate.  Is that

9   a fair statement?

10   DR. MCNEIL:  Absolutely.

11   DR. GARBER:  So, it seems to me the panel

12   concluded the data were inadequate, notwithstanding

13   the other studies we've heard about, and we could go

14   into what these studies mean, and my interpretation

15   of what we heard is that there is a solid rationale

16   to support the use of PET, but its implications for

17   health outcomes may not have been fully worked out by

18   the available literature.

19   DR. MCNEIL:  That's correct.

20   DR. GARBER:  And so therefore, the

21   question that the panel addressed, it seems to me by

22   our normal standards of adequate evidence, the

23   panel's logic would lead to a negative on this, yet

24   an affirmative on a closely related question of, do

25   we think this is likely to be helpful.  Would that be

00041

1   a fair statement of the point of view of the panel?

2   DR. MCNEIL:  So we would change that to

3   say, is it likely that PET improves health outcome.

4   DR. GARBER:  Or does it appear promising,

5   or language of that sort, because usually when we

6   talk about adequate evidence we mean that the

7   scientific basis is pretty clear, or clear enough

8   that we feel comfortable concluding that it's

9   established, and additional studies might be needed

10   to refine some details, but basically the information

11   is in, and it doesn't seem that was the conclusion

12   your panel reached.

13   DR. MCNEIL:  No, actually that's a really

14   terrific comment.  I think if we did change it, it

15   would reconcile the two slides and it would make

16   Daisy feel better as well, it's clear the data aren't

17   adequate, there's just no question about it, but

18   there is a possibility that -- so, I'm the only one

19   from the committee here, but I think that was clearly

20   in the spirit of the decision or the recommendation

21   by the committee.

22   DR. SOX:  Another way to look at that is

23   the panel is going to the point estimates for

24   sensitivity and kind of willing to ignore the broad

25   confidence intervals because statistically, you know,

00042

1   it's most likely that the point estimates will be the

2   correct estimates when you get a bigger sample.

3   DR. GARBER:  Well, Hal, actually I don't

4   think that the sample size is the fundamental issue

5   here.  The sample size is one weakness of any study

6   that has ten subjects, but for all we know there may

7   be many others, and I didn't review the many other

8   weaknesses, biases, ascertainment bias, issues in how

9   the patient populations were selected, and so I'm not

10   saying these studies are guilty of that but a full

11   review would have to account for that, and the panel

12   which did review the data, Barbara is telling us,

13   just did not feel they were adequate, and it could be

14   for any number of reasons, not only sample size.

15   DR. SOX:  I agree, point well taken.

16   Dr. Conte, if you'd like to comment, please step

17   forward.

18   DR. CONTE:  Peter Conte again, University

19   of Southern California.  I just want to also

20   reiterate that I think the panel in our opinion from

21   the public side was heavily swayed by clinical

22   practice issues in addition to the literature,

23   because there was a lot of discussion about the use

24   of PET in specific situations and how it could change

25   management.

00043

1   I also want to point out the fact that,

2   there was a comment made earlier about health

3   outcomes versus altered management by one of the

4   panelists, I don't remember who made the comment, but

5   I think that's obviously an important consideration.

6   If you're not specifically dealing with long-term

7   health outcomes that are heavily dependent on

8   therapeutic decisions, but are we using PET to make

9   specific management changes so that patients may

10   enter certain algorithms as opposed to others on the

11   basis of those findings, so again, it's important to

12   consider that in this question, if you will, the way

13   it's phrased.

14   DR. SOX:  Thank you.  Deb, please

15   introduce yourself.

16   DR. ZARIN:  Dr. Deborah Zarin, the

17   director of the technology assessment program at

18   AHRQ, and the breast cancer report was commissioned

19   by us for CMS.  As I recall the discussion at the

20   panel, the thing that was different about this was

21   that there were clinical situations where the

22   alternatives were really inadequate.  In other words,

23   there were patients with a high prior probability or

24   some moderate prior probability of having a recurrent

25   lesion, or locorecurrence, and there was no other way

00044

1   to find out where it was, and sometimes PET worked,

2   PET did identify a place where you could then go

3   biopsy.

4   As opposed to one of the earlier questions

5   somebody asked about, which is why wasn't it good

6   enough instead of a biopsy in other situations?

7   Those were cases where you knew what to biopsy and

8   the biopsy didn't cause a lot of morbidity, so it was

9   more accurate and therefore better to do biopsy.

10   What we've heard today is clinical situations where

11   it's not clear where to biopsy but there is a

12   suspicion that there's something there, and for at

13   least some patients, PET was able to sort of direct

14   more invasive work-up.  So I think that was some of

15   the discussion.  Barbara, is that your recollection?

16   DR. MCNEIL:  I think that's correct.

17   DR. ZARIN:  So it wasn't that they were

18   willing to take the point estimate of sensitivity and

19   specificity, it was sort of however good it was, it

20   was better than anything else that people could come

21   up with in that clinical situation.

22   DR. SOX:  Thanks.  That's very helpful.

23   Barbara, let's not leave Alan's point, and I'm

24   wondering whether we might want to discuss alternate

25   language on this, focusing on this issue of adequate

00045

1   evidence.

2   DR. MCNEIL:  Well, Alan had some good

3   language.  What was it, Alan?

4   DR. GARBER:  Well, let me tell you a way

5   it could be rephrased that I would have no trouble

6   dealing with, and I want to emphasize, I'm only

7   looking at the panel's internal logic.  I'm not

8   trying to make any claims that I know the evidence

9   well or anything, but I think it's quite obvious that

10   the panel seems to have contradicted itself by voting

11   in the affirmative on this particular question and

12   then also concluding the evidence is inadequate.

13   So my, I would say the panel seemed to

14   have affirmed the question, is it likely that PET

15   improves health outcomes as an adjunct, et cetera,

16   et cetera.

17   DR. SOX:  Say that one more time, not

18   quite so quickly.

19   DR. GARBER:  Is it likely that PET

20   improves health outcomes when used as an adjunct to

21   standard staging tests?

22   I think Dr. Wahl has something.

23   DR. SOX:  Dr. Wahl?

24   DR. WAHL:  Again, Richard Wahl.  I just

25   wanted, before you change the text of what the

00046

1   committee voted on, I just wondered if I was clear.

2   They did vote on the data that was presented and

3   available to them, which was more than the published

4   database, that this was the conclusion of the

5   committee.  So I wanted to just have clarification.

6   Dr. McNeil said there was inadequate data on, was it

7   your next slide?

8   DR. MCNEIL:  The previous one.

9   DR. WAHL:  Okay.  But was that conclusion

10   that there was inadequate data based on your

11   assessment as head of the Blue Cross technical

12   assessment, or was that the committee's vote that

13   there was inadequate assessment?

14   DR. MCNEIL:  Rich, I thought there were

15   two things.  I thought that our judgment about

16   inadequate data as a replacement came from the report

17   that we were given by CMS.

18   DR. WAHL:  I just didn't think that the

19   committee ever voted that there was inadequate data

20   on this particular point, that was the clarification

21   I was trying to get.

22   DR. MCNEIL:  I see.

23   DR. WAHL:  Because I think that they're

24   being put up there as equal, but I think the full

25   committee voted on the statement but the inadequate

00047

1   data, and might be helpful, I thought was your

2   assessment from your read.  So maybe I misunderstood,

3   but I thought it was worth clarification.  Maybe you

4   need to look at both slides.

5   DR. MCNEIL:  Janet, could you put them

6   back up?

7   DR. GARBER:  Well, the other one simply

8   says two published studies, inadequate data.  It

9   doesn't say anything about unpublished studies.

10   DR. WAHL:  But I am simply saying that the

11   body of evidence they examined was more than that at

12   the committee.

13   DR. MCNEIL:  Here was the problem.  We

14   examined critically the data that were presented to

15   us and that had been commissioned by AHRQ and

16   implemented by the Blue Cross TEC panel.  We analyzed

17   those data with a fine-toothed comb.  We were then

18   presented with several little summaries, 15 patients

19   here, 10 patients there, that were largely within the

20   rubric of we're just at wit's end.  Radiation therapy

21   has destroyed the anatomy, we really can't figure out

22   what's going on, and there were several of those

23   scenarios.  We actually never looked at the data for

24   those scenarios, there were no published data that

25   anybody presented.  And Rich, I have to confess, I

00048

1   haven't read your article from July, so it may very

2   well be in there.

3   We didn't look at any primary data and

4   dissect the integrity of the clinical study in terms

5   of prospective and consecutive and no verification

6   bias and blinding and blah, blah, blah.  We didn't do

7   any of that, because all we had was somebody get up

8   and say you know, 10 patients.

9   DR. BROOK:  What is the health outcome

10   that they reported to say they have influenced?

11   DR. MCNEIL:  Treatment decisions.

12   DR. BROOK:  So that's not an outcome.  I

13   mean in the true sense of the words, that's a

14   process, and in terms of what they would do next to

15   the patient.  But in terms of a health status outcome

16   or even a patient satisfaction outcome, did they

17   present any data that was an outcome?

18   DR. MCNEIL:  It depends, Bob, on what you

19   mean by an outcome for a diagnostic test.  If you

20   take as an outcome of a diagnostic test that it leads

21   you to the proper site to biopsy and therefore the

22   patient has only one biopsy instead of two biopsies,

23   some people might view that as an outcome.  Now they

24   didn't present the data for that, I'm not suggesting

25   they did, but that might be considered an outcome.

00049

1   DR. BROOK:  I have no problem with the

2   inappropriate biopsy or removal of tissue or

3   something being an outcome, but you didn't say that

4   they did that, because they --

5   DR. MCNEIL:  What they said was, and

6   they're not here, Bahs is not here, Rich is here, was

7   to say that by seeing a lesion after one test which

8   was indeterminate on MRI because of fibrosis or

9   whatever, they then were able to guide the surgeons

10   to biopsy that spot.

11   DR. BROOK:  I'm not arguing that, I

12   believe that's all true, I don't think there is any

13   question about that.

14   DR. MCNEIL:  Okay.

15   DR. BROOK:  I think the question is, is

16   that good or bad in terms of an outcome for the

17   patient?  Because you have such a high probability

18   that there is nothing there in the first place when

19   they go through all these things, then the question

20   of the treatment of what you do with this population

21   is -- I mean, I have no problem that you say if

22   you're looking for a place to biopsy in a place that

23   has -- I mean, there's lots of reasons, there's old

24   scarring in the upper lobe.

25   DR. MCNEIL:  So really what you're asking

00050

1   is would they not treat the patient in whom they have

2   a high suspicion of recurrent disease absent a

3   pathologic marker or a histologically positive

4   specimen, or would they treat the patient anyhow with

5   some new chemotherapeutic agent because the prior

6   probability of recurrent disease is so high?  That's

7   really the pivotal decision and I don't know, and we

8   have to ask our resident oncologist, and maybe Rich

9   knows.

10   DR. WAHL:  Having been there, I can

11   comment about some of the scenarios that were

12   discussed, and I know Dr. Alavi discussed one of

13   them.  But in the situation of brachial plexus

14   disease recurrence, trying to tell it from radiation

15   damage, radiation damage versus recurrent tumor,

16   obviously the treatment for radiation damage is not

17   chemotherapy.  Some chemotherapies like Taxol which

18   are common second line, or common therapy in breast

19   cancer for salvage, causes nerve damage, so giving

20   that kind of chemotherapy in somebody who already has

21   radiation induced nerve damage would not be good.

22   Similarly, not giving chemotherapy to somebody with

23   cancer would be bad as well, and in some of these

24   locations the biopsy is so difficult because the

25   biopsy is destructive and you have the nerves that go

00051

1   to the arms, so you can end up with loss of sensory

2   -- you know, in some locations it is just exceedingly

3   difficult to biopsy.

4   And before you came in, we were discussing

5   the fact that the MRs in these patients are often

6   markedly abnormal with very large areas of contrast

7   enhancement that are not specific, so in that

8   particular situation, the decision would change a

9   therapy and the therapy could have adverse effects.

10   That was just one thing discussed.

11   DR. BROOK:  I understand that.  All I'm

12   asking is, is this, when you looked at the evidence

13   on the panel, when they actually presented even the

14   studies that are not published to you, did they in

15   any way purport to show that they affected that

16   outcome positively?  I mean, this all makes a lot of

17   logic, just like the old studies from Italy made a

18   lot of logic for doing intensive screening in

19   following up women with breast cancer, just like

20   adjuvant bone marrow made a lot of logic.  There are

21   lots of things that make a lot of logic in medicine

22   but when studied they don't -- I have no problem in

23   saying this is a logical case that make a lot of

24   logic, I'm just wondering was there enough even

25   nonpublished evidence to suggest.

00052

1   DR. MCNEIL:  I think that the data that

2   were presented were of the flavor that Dr. Wahl just

3   gave.  I don't think it was anymore quantitative than

4   that.

5   DR. SOX:  Dr. Conte, do you want to

6   comment on this point?

7   DR. CONTE:  Again, I go back to the issue

8   I made before, that there is not much on long-term

9   therapeutically derived health outcome data.  So

10   again, in the article that I cited in the statement

11   this morning, 60 percent of women in this study, as

12   reported by 32 different medical oncologists, had

13   altered management on the basis of the PET findings.

14   I think that that is pretty clear.  They made 32

15   different, medical oncologists made a decision that

16   was different in 60 percent of the cases.

17   DR. SOX:  I would like to move us back

18   toward whether we're going to vote on this question

19   or another question.  Alan, you had your hand up.

20   DR. GARBER:  I think there is an important

21   point of fact, and this fact may turn into opinion

22   about what the panel really believed, and it's

23   unfortunate that we don't have the whole panel here

24   to discuss this with them, but it's whether they

25   believe that the evidence was adequate.  So we have

00053

1   heard from, we have heard that the published data was

2   clearly inadequate and I assume there was a

3   consensus, and then you're left with unpublished

4   data.  And I guess that Dr. Wahl or Dr. Conte said

5   that the unpublished data swayed the panel into

6   thinking there was adequate evidence.

7   Now, and I think Dr. McNeil believes maybe

8   that wasn't true, and that's what we're left with.

9   And I think this is a crucial point, because it

10   determines whether the affirmative answer to the

11   question really flows from the logic that the panel

12   engaged in.  But on the point of unpublished data, I

13   think it's important to point out that virtually

14   every structured evaluation of evidence discounts

15   unpublished data heavily for reasons we are all

16   familiar with.  It's pretty unusual to have, let's

17   say it's an abstract.  We've all seen time after time

18   that published abstracts when they ultimately appear

19   as published journal articles may have very different

20   conclusions, including very different results.  It's

21   very hard from many of these unpublished studies to

22   actually know what the structure of the study was to

23   determine whether the study design was reasonable and

24   would lead to reasonable outcomes.  And again, I'm

25   making general points, not points about the data that

00054

1   you discussed at the panel meeting.

2   But this I see as an important issue, was

3   the unpublished data enough to persuade the panel

4   that there was adequate evidence or did it instead

5   persuade the panel that this looked very promising,

6   would be a useful treatment.  So I think we need to

7   reach some conclusion about that and if it's the

8   latter, I would suggest we go with the alternative

9   language that I proposed, or something like it.

10   The other point though, Dr. Wahl has

11   talked about circumscribed settings in which this

12   could be very useful, which I think is important for

13   us to know and important for CMS to know in

14   determining a reimbursement policy, but he's

15   describing situations that are much more narrowly

16   circumscribed than the ones in the language on this

17   question.  So that's something I think CMS needs to

18   deal with.  It's suggesting that there are some

19   conditions in which the added information from PET

20   could be extremely useful, but that may be a small

21   subset of conditions that fit under this language.

22   DR. SOX:  Well, I put on the agenda for

23   this afternoon's discussion something to the effect

24   of unpublished and late studies and how panels should

25   deal with those, which I think the Executive

00055

1   Committee ought to discuss that and try to give some

2   direction to the panels, but meanwhile, we need to

3   move this discussion toward a vote.  Alan, you

4   directed a question to Barbara.  Barbara, do you want

5   to respond?

6   DR. MCNEIL:  Alan, I think this is a very

7   troubling question.  I presented the deliberations of

8   the committee, but I cannot emphasize how much we

9   struggled with this, and I don't think anybody would

10   want to die on the basis of the decision that they

11   made, so I think we made a considered judgment

12   listening to the facts, but the judgment was not as

13   rigorously based as it was for the other questions.

14   That is just a fact.  We did the best we could, but I

15   can honestly not say it was done with as strong an

16   information base as we had for the other questions.

17   So, having said that, the answer to your

18   question, which was did we view it on the basis of

19   adequate data, did we make a judgment on the basis of

20   adequate data or did we make a judgment on the basis

21   of promising or likely, it was clearly not the

22   former, clearly not the former, because we just had,

23   you know, I saw 11 patients kinds of scenarios, so we

24   did not look at anything rigorously presented.  So we

25   can definitely not say it was based on adequate

00056

1   evidence, and you're right, the wording here is all

2   wrong.

3   DR. SOX:  So we really need to change this

4   wording?

5   DR. MCNEIL:  The wording has to be changed

6   and I'm sorry we didn't pick that up ourselves.

7   DR. SOX:  So is it likely that rather than

8   is there adequate evidence, it is likely that?

9   DR. MCNEIL:  It is likely that is closer

10   to the spirit of the group.  Alan also, however,

11   raised the issue about whether our discussion relayed

12   to the whole panoply of patients with breast cancer

13   or with a more narrow subset, I think is what you

14   were asking, and as I recall, it was a more narrow

15   subset.  Sean was there, so you could probably recall

16   this as well, or Deborah, we really were

17   concentrating largely on the specific areas in the

18   head, neck and axilla, but we didn't have any

19   information on the other areas, to my knowledge.

20   DR. SOX:  So you accept as a friendly

21   amendment from Alan the substitution of --

22   DR. MCNEIL:  It is likely that.

23   DR. SOX:  Is it likely that, in the form

24   of a question.

25   DR. MCNEIL:  Yes.

00057

1   DR. SOX:  Okay.  So that's been resolved.

2   Now we'll go on to other people.  I don't know who

3   had their hand up first.  Bob will start.

4   DR. BROOK:  I'm just wondering if we just

5   ought to state what the person stated, that there is

6   adequate evidence that PET improves, changes decision

7   making.

8   DR. MCNEIL:  I don't know that we had data

9   on it.  We did not review that article, Bob, so I

10   can't say that that was a good article.

11   DR. BROOK:  Well, you had a lot of

12   unpublished data and you had reports that people

13   changed decision making.  And you also have evidence

14   that they changed decision making based on a logic

15   that would relate, an implicit logic, a medical

16   clinical logic that would relate that to outcomes,

17   but there is no evidence that that logic has been

18   tested to affirm that that is indeed true.  That

19   seems like what you're saying.

20   DR. MCNEIL:  No, that's not what I'm

21   saying.  I do not believe that we had at the time,

22   and I cannot accept information from an article that

23   the panel has not yet reviewed, that those studies

24   were adequate to show that patient management was

25   changed.  It is likely that, I accept that, I cannot

00058

1   accept the adequate in patient management.

2   DR. BROOK:  Well, we're not making the

3   coverage decision.  If HCFA wanted to say, or we

4   wanted to say from your panel, was there enough data

5   presented in some form, that the panel believed there

6   was adequate data to show the tests were being used

7   in a way that changed from a prior to a post decision

8   of what could be done, because that's important for

9   HCFA to put in the hopper if it decides to make, or

10   when it decides what to do with the coverage

11   decision.

12   That sounded like you were all in

13   agreement, and indeed you believe that there was

14   enough data in the series available to support that

15   doctors were using these data to change their

16   decisions.

17   DR. MCNEIL:  Well, again, it depends upon

18   what you mean by data, Bob.  We did not have an

19   adequate review, we did not critically review the

20   data to suggest that I would feel comfortable

21   speaking on behalf of the committee to say that the

22   data were adequate to support that PET improves

23   management decisions.  It may be true but we did not

24   have the data at our hands to do that, and I don't

25   know about this one article in September's JNM.  I do

00059

1   believe we supported the decision that it is likely

2   that.

3   DR. SOX:  Okay.  Staying with this point,

4   Wade.

5   DR. AUBRY:  Yes.  Before we change the

6   question, I would like to just add another dimension

7   and that is the issue of prognosis or prognostic

8   information.  Much of the discussion we have had

9   about unpublished evidence or data is basically that

10   it would change management decisions, but another

11   piece to this is prognosis, and if PET shows that

12   it's Stage IV disease rather than local disease, then

13   that's obviously a significant prognostic issue, and

14   I wondered if that came up in the discussion or was

15   that mentioned, because some people feel, myself

16   included, that prognostic information is a health

17   outcome.

18   DR. MCNEIL:  We discussed the questions

19   that were asked of us and reviewed the data

20   associated with those questions.  If you were to ask

21   about whether PET, I guess the question you're asking

22   me is should PET be used at the time of the initial

23   diagnosis of breast cancer to stage patients; is that

24   what you're asking?

25   DR. AUBRY:  That's not what I'm talking

00060

1   about.  This specific situation we're talking about,

2   the adjunct situation, where the unpublished

3   discussion seems to indicate that there are some

4   patients who were thought to have local disease who

5   were in fact found to have distant metastases or

6   Stage IV disease on the basis of this adjunctive test

7   after others were done and not shown that.

8   DR. MCNEIL:  That's correct, so really

9   implicit in the wording here is, whatever wording we

10   take, if we detected distant disease then we've

11   obviously changed stage, just by definition and then

12   that obviously changes prognosis, so they are

13   implicitly part of one another, right?  So I don't

14   know that we need a separate question about prognosis

15   because that's imbedded in the whole discovery of

16   distant disease.

17   DR. AUBRY:  Yeah, maybe there's not really

18   an answer to that question.  I think it is something

19   to keep in mind because we seem to be struggling with

20   the idea of this unpublished data changes management,

21   it's unclear whether that improves health outcomes,

22   it may well improve health outcomes, but we don't

23   know, but prognostic information itself may be very

24   important to a patient, maybe an outcome a patient

25   could feel regardless of whether that change in

00061

1   treatment management actually improves the health

2   outcome of the patient in terms of survival.  I just

3   thought we should factor that into the discussion as

4   well.

5   DR. SOX:  Dr. Conte, did you want to make

6   a comment at this point?

7   DR. CONTE:  Yes.  I just want to point out

8   that the panel felt on the basis of what was

9   presented and what was in the literature, both, that

10   there was adequate evidence to answer this question.

11   That's what they voted on.  This was what was

12   presented to them.

13   I think it should also be disclosed that

14   five voted affirmatively and one abstained.  The

15   person that abstained, if I'm not mistaken, was

16   Dr. McNeil.

17   DR. MCNEIL:  No, that's not true.

18   MR. CONTE:  That's not correct?

19   DR. MCNEIL:  No, it's not.

20   DR. CONTE:  You voted for?  Who abstained?

21   DR. MCNEIL:  I don't know who abstained.

22   MS. ANDERSON:  I think it was Jeff Lerner.

23   DR. CONTE:  Okay.  So the fact of the

24   matter is that the majority of the members of the

25   committee voted this question that there was adequate

00062

1   evidence presented at the Diagnostic Imaging Panel

2   for this indication.

3   DR. MCNEIL:  You know, Peter, I'm not sure

4   about that to be perfectly honest.  We would have to

5   go back and do a line-by-line analysis of the

6   minutes.

7   DR. CONTE:  I have the minutes here.

8   DR. MCNEIL:  Okay.  If we voted that, just

9   to be -- if you want the spirit of the deliberations,

10   and I don't know whether you do, Dr. Sox.

11   DR. SOX:  Well, it's our job to try to

12   capture the spirit of the discussion, and we as an

13   executive committee can alter the wording of a

14   resolution if we feel by so doing it fits, it more

15   adequately describes the tenor of the discussion, and

16   we listen to you as the representative of the panel

17   to give us advice on that.

18   DR. GARBER:  How they voted, that's a

19   matter of record.

20   DR. MCNEIL:  The sense of the panel,

21   whatever the word of the deliberations was, and I

22   tried to convey it in my remarks by saying had the

23   wind blown a little bit differently, the five to one

24   vote could have switched.  I mean, that was

25   realistically the way we were thinking about it, so I

00063

1   do not believe that the spirit of the committee was

2   that there was adequate evidence.  I think Alan's

3   assessment of the wording is much closer to what our

4   feelings were at the time.

5   DR. SOX:  And I personally believe that

6   the committee ought to be listening to Barbara rather

7   than the record as it's reflected there, and trusting

8   Barbara as a representative of the panel to tell us.

9   DR. BROOK:  I really don't understand, I

10   must object.  Barbara voted for this thing, Barbara

11   understood the words of this thing, this is what was

12   voted on.

13   DR. MCNEIL:  Well, could I just clarify,

14   Bob?

15   DR. BROOK:  I really don't understand what

16   we're doing here.

17   DR. MCNEIL:  Let me clarify for you.  What

18   happened, I prepared these slides quickly at three

19   p.m. yesterday when Janet told me I was making the

20   presentation, so prepared these slides 15 minutes

21   before leaving for the airport.  So if there is some

22   sloppiness in the wording, I apologize.  If I had had

23   more time --

24   DR. BROOK:  So this is not what you voted

25   on then?  Can we get the minutes from the committee

00064

1   of what actually -- I mean do we know, because what

2   we're being asked to do is overturn a vote that the

3   chairman of the committee voted for and is now

4   presenting it differently here.  It's not like there

5   was vast disagreement and we're being asked to, this

6   was so close.  A five to one vote doesn't look very

7   close.  You as the chairman voted for it, and is this

8   what you all voted for?

9   DR. MCNEIL:  I do not believe, Bob, that

10   this is what we voted for in spirit.  I believe what

11   we voted for was Alan's wording.

12   DR. TUNIS:  Can I make a comment, because

13   as another person who was at the meeting and, I

14   believe, it seems to me a fair amount of this

15   confusion is simply over different interpretations of

16   what the word evidence means here.  I think what the

17   committee concluded was that the published evidence

18   was by itself inadequate to support a conclusion of

19   the clinical benefit, health improvement of using PET

20   under these circumstances.

21   The committee listened to a lot of public

22   testimony and there was a lot of discussion about the

23   logic of using PET in various specified

24   circumstances.  Dr. Wahl described some of them,

25   others described some of them, and I believe when the

00065

1   committee voted on this question, they were including

2   using evidence as a broad term to mean not just

3   published and unpublished evidence but the expert

4   testimony that was provided.  And so all adequate

5   evidence meant here was the body of everything we

6   have heard supported this conclusion, just barely,

7   but the committee was willing to support that five to

8   one.

9   If they had specifically asked the

10   question, is there adequate evidence from these two

11   published studies to support this conclusion, I

12   believe the committee would say no to that question.

13   They're just two different questions that seem to be

14   wrapped into the same question.  So I don't really

15   think there is as much disagreement here as it sounds

16   like.

17   DR. MCNEIL:  So we should have had a

18   second mitosis on this question.

19   (Laughter.)

20   DR. SOX:  Anybody else want to pick up the

21   discussion at this point?

22   DR. FRANCIS:  I think I understood what

23   was just said but I want to be clear about this,

24   because I thought really that two different problems

25   for the committee keep getting put together.  And one

00066

1   of the problems was what to do with either

2   unpublished or new studies that happen after you get

3   a TEC report, okay, so that was one problem, and how

4   do you decide whether they are adequate or not or how

5   do you think about them.

6   The other problem was what to do when the

7   question changes, so that the question that you ended

8   up talking about was, does PET affect patient

9   management in the very narrow class of cases in which

10   you tried other diagnostic modalities, there is a

11   high suspicion, high prior probability of recurrence,

12   and the other diagnostic modalities haven't told you

13   anything informative.  Does PET in those

14   circumstances affect patient management, which is a

15   different question than -- the original question that

16   the panel was asked was a much broader question.

17   So two things were going on.  One was new

18   studies were getting thrown at you, and the other was

19   that the question was being changed.  And so what you

20   ended up saying was that there is a logic here, but

21   there isn't any evidence.  I think that's what Alan

22   was saying a while ago.  I don't know whether one

23   would want here is changes in patient management,

24   changes in prognosis or changes in outcome, but it's

25   clear there are changes, and at least clinicians do

00067

1   change management because they can find the place to

2   biopsy in that very very limited class of

3   circumstances.

4   DR. SOX:  Could I just read from the

5   minutes a selection that is I think pertinent to our

6   discussion.  It states here, and this is in respect

7   to this indication, at the request of the HCFA

8   medical officer Mitchell Burken, M.D., the panel

9   discussed the level of effectiveness of PET in this

10   indication, what we're talking about, but was unable

11   to reach consensus upon which level of effectiveness

12   had been established by the evidence.

13   So it does sound like you did not come to

14   a conclusion about whether the evidence was adequate

15   or not.  I think this statement from the minutes

16   supports your interpretation of the sense of the

17   meeting at that time.

18   DR. MCNEIL:  I think that is absolutely

19   right, Hal.  I think what Leslie has said though, and

20   is probably the reason, and what Sean said earlier,

21   why we're having this discussion now is the fact that

22   the committee felt, was really very very confused in

23   having data presented to us without having the

24   ability to digest it clearly and carefully, was

25   something that we really had not expected and did not

00068

1   know how to deal with in an effective fashion, so we

2   had really two options, as I recall.

3   One was, because I don't know that the

4   guidelines for this have been entirely worked out yet

5   for this panel, but dealing with new data, when

6   somebody gets up and says 11 patients and two of them

7   were this and three of them were that, and they were

8   followed for three months and the MR was this, it's

9   very very difficult to do.  So we were left with two

10   alternatives.  One was to basically table this and

11   say bring back the data that everybody has presented

12   in a structured format and have us review them, take

13   all the published data that Rich says is in his

14   article, and review it and then make a judgment.  Or

15   vote on it with some less rigorous approach to our

16   interpretation and to modify, despite what the

17   wording says or what the minutes says, we did not

18   believe the published data were adequate.  So to have

19   some kind of sentence there that reflected that it is

20   likely that on the basis of the anecdotal information

21   that was presented to us, that this would work.

22   But on behalf of our committee, I would

23   like very much to know what to do with new data, new

24   questions that come up on the spot, because I don't

25   think we can deal with them properly.

00069

1   DR. SOX:  We will discuss that this

2   afternoon.  I think we ought to take a vote as a way

3   to resolve this issue, and we'll just give Dr. Zarin

4   a chance to speak, and then I would like a motion and

5   a vote.

6   DR. ZARIN:  I would just like to make two

7   points.  One is, I think that, I guess it's now

8   called Alan's proposed language, did capture the

9   spirit as I heard it, with one proposed addition,

10   which would be I forget the exact language, but is it

11   likely that the use of PET as an adjunct will help, I

12   think putting in the words some patients, which isn't

13   as precise as many people would want, but I think

14   that the panel as I recall it was talking about a

15   more narrow group of patients than that would imply,

16   but wasn't really able to specify exactly what that

17   group.  You know, the spirit was there were some

18   patients for whom there is nothing else that's going

19   to be helpful and this has been reportedly helpful

20   sometimes.  So think about something like the word

21   some.

22   The other thing I'd caution you against is

23   saying that you're doing this because you're

24   accepting change in management as the outcome.  I

25   think in the negative answers to some of the earlier

00070

1   questions, Barbara pointed out that the reason for

2   the negative answer in part didn't have to do with

3   the fact that they didn't think PET would change

4   management but that they were worried that the change

5   in management would be based on misinformation, so

6   that there was a worry about undertreatment, either

7   under biopsy or under dissection of the nodes because

8   of false positives or false negatives.

9   So that, I think the panel in other

10   instances with PET was worried that the change in

11   management which would occur would not be in the

12   patient's best interests.  However in this instance,

13   there was more a sense of knowing where to biopsy,

14   somehow I think must have felt more secure to panel

15   members than knowing not to biopsy or not to dissect

16   lymph nodes.

17   DR. SOX:  So at this point we're going to

18   entertain, give somebody an opportunity if they wish

19   to make a motion about changing the wording of this

20   recommendation so it fits a little bit better with

21   the published record and the account given by a

22   number of observers of that discussion.  And then we

23   will go on to discuss the rest of the report and

24   actually make a vote for approval or disapproval, and

25   further discussion will occur in the context of

00071

1   discussing the motion.

2   MS. ANDERSON:  Before we do that I would

3   like to make a statement for the record.  For today's

4   panel meeting, voting members present are Wade Aubry,

5   Robert Brook, Barbara McNeil, Thomas Holohan, Leslie

6   Francis, John Ferguson, Robert Murray, Alan Garber,

7   Michael Maves, Joe Johnson and Daisy Alford-Smith.

8   Dr. Harold Sox will vote in the event of a tie.  A

9   quorum is present, no one has been recused because of

10   conflicts of interest, and now we can go ahead with

11   the motion.

12   MS. RICHNER:  May I say one thing before

13   you go forward with a motion?

14   DR. SOX:  Yes.

15   MS. RICHNER:  I would like to know the

16   generalizability of this data to the Medicare

17   population of 65 and older, so what, does anybody

18   have any idea what the scope of this population would

19   be for this decision?  I mean, what are the numbers

20   of patients that we're talking about here that would

21   actually benefit from this coverage decision?

22   DR. SOX:  Well, breast cancer is a very

23   common problem.

24   MS. RICHNER:  I know, but 65 and older.

25   SPEAKER:  About 150,000.

00072

1   MS. RICHNER:  About 150,000, okay.

2   DR. SOX:  Bob?

3   DR. BROOK:  You know, I don't know if we

4   have to do anything, because when I read the complete

5   minutes under number 4, which you read a piece of it,

6   the sense of what the committee did is absolutely

7   reflected in there.  They said the evidence was

8   adequate but they couldn't judge the effectiveness,

9   they contradicted themselves.  And I wonder whether

10   we can improve what they did.  That's what they did,

11   and we could just add a note saying that because they

12   couldn't deal with effectiveness from the MCAC

13   committee approach, from our committee approach, this

14   means that the evidence was inadequate based on the

15   guidance that we had given the committees in the

16   stuff we have done before.  Because if the evidence

17   was adequate, they ought to have been able to answer

18   the last question.

19   So instead of overruling what they did,

20   why don't we just accept what they did and make a

21   very simple statement that says we're disturbed by

22   the contradiction between the first task and the

23   second task under 4, because if the evidence was

24   really adequate, then they ought to have been able to

25   reach a consensus on the level of effectiveness,

00073

1   which they were unable to do.  Without changing

2   wording, without trying to second guess and change

3   all this other kind of stuff, which undermines the

4   whole process of the panels, why don't we just accept

5   -- I would propose we accept this, and we point out

6   to HCFA the fact that because they couldn't do the

7   last part as opposed to the front, that this does not

8   fulfill in some way the guidelines of adequate

9   evidence as decided by the MCAC in its instructions

10   in terms of what adequate evidence means.

11   DR. GARBER:  Are you saying to ratify

12   this, Bob?

13   DR. BROOK:  They did it.  I don't think

14   it's fair.  We have to go back to the whole panel

15   process.  I mean, every time we open this there is a

16   can of worms, because on all the other motions they

17   said, well, changes in medical treatment may not be

18   adequate to do this, all of a sudden we have somebody

19   get up and say well, this may change where to biopsy

20   or whether you want to have more radiation or

21   chemotherapy.  I believe all that and for any one of

22   those other statements, you could have said exactly

23   the same thing.  Somehow on this one, they concluded

24   this.  They concluded it in a very wishy-washy way.

25   And all we need to do is point out as we

00074

1   ratify this report to whatever this place is called

2   now, that the bottom line is the panel itself

3   contradicted itself in terms of this question and

4   point out to the panel without trying to do anything

5   further, and it's in the minutes.

6   DR. SOX:  I want to get this discussion

7   over with and the best way to do that is to have a

8   formal motion, a discussion of the motion, and then

9   the committee can decide whether or not the proposed

10   language is the language they want to vote on, and

11   when we vote ultimately to affirm or disaffirm the

12   panel's work.

13   So if you want to do this, Bob, make a

14   motion.

15   DR. BROOK:  I move to adopt the language

16   under section 4 as the sense of the panel, and not

17   just the first part.  There's two pieces of it.  You

18   read the second part.

19   I move we accept the full discussion

20   under 4.  There are two parts to it, that they said

21   yes to the question and no to the level of being able

22   to identify the level of effectiveness.

23   DR. MCNEIL:  We actually separated -- I

24   don't know what you're reading from, Bob.

25   DR. BROOK:  Your minutes.  Now if these

00075

1   minutes aren't accurate, then there is something

2   really -- I mean, this is, whoever Janet Anderson is.

3   MS. ANDERSON:  That would be me.

4   DR. BROOK:  Hi, Janet.  You certified the

5   minutes.

6   DR. MCNEIL:  So what we actually voted on,

7   Bob, was we actually split question 4 formally when

8   we voted.

9   DR. BROOK:  Which is right there, but

10   there's a second part to it.

11   DR. MCNEIL:  No, there's a first -- you

12   came in late.  There is a previous slide that shows

13   we actually split question 4 when we voted.

14   (Inaudible colloquy, several people

15   speaking.)

16   DR. MCNEIL:  This is how it was presented,

17   if you look up here, this is the original question.

18   The operative phrase is in blue.

19   DR. BROOK:  You resplit it.

20   DR. MCNEIL:  We split it into two parts.

21   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  I'm looking at the

22   minutes.

23   DR. MCNEIL:  Okay.  I'm telling you what

24   we did.

25   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  Did you take a negative

00076

1   vote on that?

2   DR. MCNEIL:  Yes, we did.

3   DR. BROOK:  Where?

4   DR. MCNEIL:  We took a negative vote on

5   the replacement and an affirmative vote on the

6   adjunct.

7   DR. BROOK:  It says the question was then

8   changed, but did you deal with the other piece of the

9   question?

10   DR. MCNEIL:  Yeah.  Look as it is now,

11   Bob.  The question was split into two parts.  This is

12   the first part --

13   DR. BROOK:  You say there's negative --

14   DR. SOX:  Don't interrupt, okay.  Let's

15   not interrupt each other trying to get through this

16   discussion.

17   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  So that becomes

18   question 5, so that was the original question?

19   DR. MCNEIL:  Forget about the numbers.  We

20   voted on this question, and then we voted on the next

21   question.

22   DR. BROOK:  No, you voted on that question

23   and then you were requested by, I'm following the

24   minutes, you were requested by the HCFA medical

25   officer to indicate the level of evidence for this

00077

1   question, and you couldn't reach agreement.

2   DR. MCNEIL:  We could not.  No, it wasn't

3   that we couldn't reach agreement, we just didn't know

4   what it was.  There was no discussion about whether

5   it was big or little.

6   DR. BROOK:  This says that you were asked

7   to -- I'm just trying to read -- discuss the level of

8   effectiveness but were unable to reach a consensus on

9   what level of effectiveness had been established.

10   DR. MCNEIL:  And if I could state

11   precisely what happened, that is we did not know.  I

12   didn't say it was a big one and somebody else said it

13   was a little one, we just didn't know.

14   MS. ANDERSON:  As the author of the

15   summary, I can state for you that this is an

16   abbreviated version of the minutes and as a summary

17   of the minutes, this is capturing -- there were four

18   abstentions when we decided to vote on the level of

19   effectiveness so it didn't carry, it wasn't a motion

20   that didn't carry.

21   DR. BROOK:  Hal, is there some way because

22   this contradicts the first part of this, that we can

23   just say that, and vote on it?  I mean, if they can't

24   define the level of evidence and they said the

25   evidence is adequate, what's the policy here?

00078

1   DR. MCNEIL:  I will take full

2   responsibility here for making a mistake.  If we want

3   to talk about the exact word-by-word description of

4   what is in those documents, that's one line of

5   thinking.  If we want to talk about what the spirit

6   of the discussion was as well as I can synthesize it,

7   I'm happy to do that.  I can't mix both of them up in

8   the same paragraph, so which would you like me to do,

9   Dr. Sox, the word by word or the spirit?

10   DR. SOX:  Personally, I think we have had

11   a number of attestations to the spirit of that

12   discussion and they are all in the same direction and

13   I think that's the route we should go.

14   DR. MCNEIL:  So if that's the route we

15   want to go, I take full responsibility in making an

16   error on this slide as I was rushing to the airport

17   with 15 minutes to go in my wording for this

18   question.

19   DR. SOX:  Okay.  Now, with that, I would

20   like to entertain a motion to change the wording.  If

21   there is no motion, then we will vote on what we

22   have.  Would anybody like to make a motion that will

23   clarify the discussion so that what we're going to

24   vote on comes closer to what has been described as

25   the character of the discussion?  Alan.

00079

1   DR. GARBER:  I would like to move that we

2   modify the language as I previously suggested, is it

3   likely that PET improves health outcomes when used as

4   an adjunct, keeping the rest of the language.

5   I don't know whether this would be part of

6   the same motion or not, but I think there should be

7   instructions to HCFA staff that it was the sense of

8   the Executive Committee that the specific uses for

9   PET in this setting need to be more clearly

10   delineated, and also to reflect the spirit of the

11   panel, and that could be separate.

12   SPEAKER:  For some patients, did you want

13   that?

14   DR. GARBER:  Yeah, for some patients.

15   DR. FRANCIS:  Shouldn't your motion be

16   that we affirm the decision of the panel insofar as

17   what you just said, and otherwise not -- we don't

18   change what the panel did.

19   DR. SOX:  See, we're trying to get some

20   language so that we can make a vote either indication

21   by indication or for everything, and so that is a

22   second step.  So Alan, please repeat your language

23   and we will see if there's a second, then we will

24   have a discussion of your language and hopefully

25   vote.

00080

1   DR. GARBER:  The first line becomes, is it

2   likely that PET.  Second line is modified so that it

3   says, improves health outcomes when used as an

4   adjunct to -- yeah, for some patients.  When used as

5   an adjunct to standard staging tests in detecting,

6   et cetera, et cetera, and when it says when results,

7   for some patients comes before when, so it becomes

8   for some patients when results from other tests are

9   inconclusive.

10   DR. AUBRY:  Can you read it now so what it

11   says, is it likely there is adequate evidence or is

12   there --

13   DR. BARBER:  No, no.  Adequate evidence is

14   struck.  Is it likely that PET improves health

15   outcomes --

16   DR. MCNEIL:  Janet, could you change that

17   on line now, can't you just edit it?

18   MS. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  If someone wants to

19   second, I can read the full motion.

20   DR. MCNEIL:  I second.

21   (Inaudible colloquy.)

22   MS. ANDERSON:  Okay.  The motion is to

23   change the wording of question 4 to, is it likely

24   that PET improves health outcomes when used as an

25   adjunct to standard staging tests in detecting

00081

1   locoregional recurrence or distant metastases

2   recurrence for some patients when results from other

3   tests are inconclusive.

4   DR. SOX:  Now that language is open for

5   discussion.  Bob?

6   DR. BROOK:  Barbara, if I went to question

7   1, 2 and 3 in your minutes and substituted that

8   language for adequate evidence for each one of those

9   questions, which says it may affect some patients and

10   there is a likelihood, would you have voted yes on

11   all of those motions?

12   DR. MCNEIL:  We would have voted no on

13   none of the motions except for -- we would not have

14   voted yes on any of the motions.

15   DR. BROOK:  Is there some likelihood, is

16   there likelihood that PET can improve health outcomes

17   by leading to earlier diagnosis or breast cancer

18   compared to short interval mammography for some

19   patients?  If I change that the way I have changed it

20   now under 4, my guess is it would be almost

21   impossible for the panel not to have voted

22   affirmative on those questions because all that means

23   is somebody has to come up and show that for three

24   patients it made a difference.  That's all that has

25   to happen.

00082

1   This trivializes the question that you

2   were asked to do.  You were asked to look at adequate

3   evidence to find out whether there's adequate

4   evidence against some method.  The way we have

5   rephrased this question is a noninteresting question.

6   DR. MCNEIL:  Well, I don't know, Bob, if

7   you had a chance to read the report, did you?

8   DR. BROOK:  I did not read the whole

9   report.

10   DR. MCNEIL:  If you read the report, you

11   would see that if you just look at the data and the

12   clinical logic, it would be very difficult under any

13   circumstances, and I can ask Sean or some of the

14   others who are here to say that our vote would be

15   changed under any scenario of additional information.

16   The implications of false negatives on undertreatment

17   in a majority of the situations was just enormous,

18   and I don't think there is any circumstance that

19   would have change.

20   DR. SOX:  I read the evidence report and I

21   concur with Barbara's judgment.  Mike, you're next.

22   DR. MAVES:  The problem I have is I

23   understand where we're going and I understand what

24   we're trying to do in the spirit of the discussion.

25   The difficulty I have is I think from a procedural

00083

1   standpoint.  I do sort of object to changing a

2   question and then ascribing the votes that took place

3   in a meeting a period of time ago to that changed

4   question.  I would, I think we were getting close

5   there, I would accept the report, accept the votes,

6   but then obviously annotate this question to state

7   that after discussion at the Executive Committee we

8   felt that the spirit of the discussion more closely

9   answered the question, and then put Alan's question,

10   because I do think it does capture the spirit.

11   But I have to say, I'm bothered a little

12   bit by changing language in a question and then

13   ascribing the votes of the committee who aren't here

14   to sort of challenges or to revote, and I think Bob

15   has a lot of merit in what he says.  If we had

16   changed other language on other questions, that could

17   have changed as well.  But I think it's a way of,

18   what you want is the spirit of this to help guide

19   HCFA in the decision making process, but I think we

20   really can either accept or refute the report and the

21   questions that were asked.  I'm bothered by changing

22   the question and then ascribing the vote to that

23   changed question.

24   DR. SOX:  Well in that case, you should

25   vote against the motion, and then we can consider

00084

1   another motion.  Alan?

2   DR. GARBER:  Actually, I completely agree

3   with both Bob and Mike, that we don't want to change

4   the vote of the panel members, and I hope nobody took

5   my motion in that spirit.  My motion is really about

6   what we the Executive Committee conclude, not about

7   what the panel concluded.  What the panel concluded

8   is a matter of record, we are not trying to rewrite

9   the history, but there is an obvious glaring

10   contradiction in the panel's deliberations if we take

11   as a given that in fact they did not believe that the

12   evidence was conclusive.

13   So rather than us ratifying the panel's

14   conclusion or in any way saying that we thought it

15   was correct, we are trying to capture the spirit of

16   what we believe the panel intended by substituting

17   some language and adopting something closely related

18   to their conclusions as the Executive Committee.  So

19   my motion is about what the Executive Committee

20   concludes, not about what the panel concluded.

21   DR. SOX:  In any case, this is advice to

22   HCFA about the state of evidence, so it's not like

23   we're making a judgment that is absolute, it's simply

24   giving advice to HCFA.

25   DR. MAVES:  Hal, if I could ask Alan then,

00085

1   I assume that my comments then are not different than

2   what you intended by your motion?

3   DR. GARBER:  No, I think we intend the

4   same thing.

5   DR. MAVES:  Would you accept that then as

6   a friendly amendment, I suppose is the next question.

7   DR. GARBER:  But if we do not ratify the

8   panel -- this is the Executive Committee's

9   conclusions which we believe reflect more closely the

10   logic of the panel's conclusions, but this means we

11   don't necessarily accept the panel, I mean we accept

12   it as a fact that that's how they voted, but we don't

13   in any sense endorse it.

14   DR. MAVES:  And I think that's consistent

15   with where I'm coming from.

16   DR. SOX:  Would anybody else like to

17   discuss the amendment as it now is projected on the

18   screen?  Daisy?

19   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  It's really not an

20   amendment, it's really a comment by the Executive

21   Committee, because if it's an amendment, you're

22   replacing what the panel said.

23   DR. GARBER:  Yeah.  This is amended

24   language.  In other words, this is the Executive

25   Committee's own recommendation and it uses amended

00086

1   language, so yes, what Daisy says is quite right.

2   Again, we're not trying to say they didn't vote as

3   they did and we're not trying to say they voted on

4   something different than they did.  We obviously

5   can't do that and we wouldn't want to do that.  This

6   is amended language which we are adopting as the

7   Executive Committee's recommendation.

8   DR. SOX:  As our recommendation to HCFA.

9   Wade.

10   DR. AUBRY:  As a new member of the

11   Executive Committee, it seems to me that we were

12   asked either to ratify or not ratify this decision,

13   and what is the sense of the discussion in the last

14   few minutes is that several members of the panel here

15   are not comfortable ratifying the exact language, the

16   original language.  And therefore, I would say that

17   perhaps we should not ratify this and then have a

18   substitute motion which Alan has made, which is the

19   sense if it's voted affirmatively, would give the

20   sense of the Executive Committee on what transpired

21   at the meeting of the imaging panel.

22   So, I guess my question for HCFA staff or

23   for Dr. Sox is, are we being asked as an executive

24   committee to ratify or not ratify, is that what we

25   are being asked?

00087

1   DR. SOX:  I think we're being asked to

2   approve or disapprove the language of the panel and

3   if we disapprove it, we can either do that in a way

4   that qualifies our disapproval, which might be to

5   approve another statement that we think more

6   accurately reflects the discussion and the evidence.

7   So, Alan?

8   DR. GARBER:  Well, maybe, can I accept

9   Wade's comment as basically a friendly amendment?

10   What my motion was intended to do was in one step

11   deal with what Wade is talking about doing in two

12   steps, that is, the Executive Committee does not

13   approve, ratify, whatever the operative language is,

14   the original recommendation of this particular item

15   4.B, I guess it is, of the panel, and accepts all the

16   others.  But it does approve a closely related

17   amended version of that as the Executive Committee's

18   recommendation, which is the language that I

19   describe.

20   DR. SOX:  So, if I understand Wade

21   correctly, I think you were stating that what we

22   really should do is to express our dissatisfaction

23   with the statement as approved by the panel and as

24   reflected accurately in the minutes, and then if we

25   don't approve that language, if we think it is

00088

1   basically an inaccurate statement of the state of the

2   evidence, then approve substitute language.

3   DR. AUBRY:  That's correct.  It's a first

4   order, second order issue.

5   DR. SOX:  In that case, I think we'd have

6   to, if we wanted to move in that direction, then the

7   original proposer, I think -- I'm getting a little

8   bit beyond Roberts Rules of Orders, or my

9   understanding, but I think you could withdraw your

10   motion.

11   DR. GARBER:  Well, consider me having

12   withdrawn it and substituted, and actually I think

13   it's a friendly amendment, which then the seconder,

14   who was Leslie, would have to approve.

15   DR. FRANCIS:  I agree to that.

16   DR. SOX:  So am I correct then that you

17   have withdrawn your motion at this point?

18   DR. GARBER:  No, I clarified it.  I'm

19   accepting a substitution in the motion as it was just

20   stated.

21   DR. FRANCIS:  And I second that

22   substitution, which is that we accept all but the one

23   that has been the subject of discussion, and we also

24   accept the closely related as our recommendation to

25   HCFA.

00089

1   DR. SOX:  I'm sorry.  I'm now the one

2   who's having trouble here.

3   DR. GARBER:  The motion as amended, and as

4   seconded, is that the Executive Committee approves or

5   ratifies all of the recommendations of the panel

6   except this one, which I believe is 4.B, and the

7   Executive Committee makes an alternative

8   recommendation which is the following, and that uses

9   our language.

10   DR. SOX:  So that's really a compound

11   motion?

12   DR. GARBER:  Yeah.

13   DR. SOX:  Are people comfortable with

14   doing it that way, or would you prefer to vote first

15   to approve the original statement and then if we

16   decide to not to approve that, then we could approve

17   a modified statement that would change the language

18   of 4.B and we could vote on that.

19   DR. MURRAY:  I'm comfortable with Alan's

20   motion.

21   DR. MAVES:  I am too.

22   DR. SOX:  It sounds like we have a

23   majority of the voting members who are comfortable

24   with handling it in the manner Alan has proposed

25   instead of as a single motion.  Yes please?

00090

1   DR. BROOK:  I'm sorry to do this but I

2   think what we've been trying to do is set up a

3   process to increase faith in the panels.  You have an

4   easy way out here.  All you have to do is say the

5   Executive Committee has read the discussion in the

6   minutes under 4.  Because the panel themselves were

7   unable to reach a consensus on the level of evidence,

8   they said that, they couldn't reach a consensus, that

9   procedurally we cannot accept motion 4 that the panel

10   found, that there was adequate evidence.  They

11   themselves contradicted themselves, and we ought to

12   just vote that we can't do that.

13   We ought not vote on the new motion.  We

14   could encourage HCFA.  We haven't seen the evidence.

15   We're now subverting the whole damned process that

16   somebody spent two days sitting there, voting a new

17   motion without looking at any evidence and without

18   having been tasked to do that.  Our job would then be

19   to say if we think there are other unresolved issues

20   about this procedure, it ought to go back to the

21   diagnostic committee with a note from us to say would

22   you please consider these kinds of other questions,

23   because we think they're important.

24   We can't be a second judge here, because

25   it's going to stop anyway in January, and why don't

00091

1   we set the precedent here to actually look at the

2   process which is what we have been trying over the

3   last year and a half to do.  And you've got an out

4   here.  It's absolutely clear that you can just say we

5   can't accept this motion because the panel themselves

6   didn't.

7   DR. MCNEIL:  Hal, I think this goes back

8   to what I talked about earlier and I think we should

9   be voting, I think I'm being an impartial observer of

10   the process, and Sean is here and several others were

11   here as well.  I think that what is there, Bob, is

12   what we in spirit were voting on.

13   DR. BROOK:  This is a legal process.  We

14   spent hours and days going through public comment and

15   all of this about the process.  We word smithed these

16   documents that we gave to the panels umpteen times.

17   We're trying to improve the panel process.  If we sit

18   here and in two hours come up with a new question and

19   a new vote because we think we did this better than

20   you did it, we're subverting this whole process.

21   Even though we may be correct, I will give

22   the notion that Alan and Hal are correct on this,

23   this is what it would come out, that's not the issue.

24   The issue here is, we've got to build up a strong

25   process where when people come to testify in front of

00092

1   these panels, they have confidence that the panels

2   are going to come up with decisions, that we are

3   going to look at their decision, and as long as the

4   process is fulfilled in the way that we've talked

5   about it, that we would then go ahead and improve the

6   process and not second guess everything.  Because

7   then we ought to have another open discussion, we

8   ought to hear those cases, we ought to spend as much

9   time as you did on it.  You guys spent much much more

10   time on this and read many more articles than we

11   have.  And I'm just urging us to be faithful to the

12   process.

13   DR. TUNIS:  Let me just as a point of view

14   of process and what would be helpful to us, because I

15   think, you know, all the ideas are on the table and I

16   don't think you can give any clearer sense to HCFA,

17   CMS than you have already.  So I think, I don't think

18   it's worth actually going round and round on this.  I

19   think to kind of go along with Bob's suggestion, I

20   think what would be helpful to us you go ahead, and

21   if I'm getting you right, Bob, essentially you don't

22   ratify this recommendation because it's internally

23   consistent, so it's not ratified.  You ratify all the

24   others if that's what you want to do, and we've got

25   the spirit of your new question, so we understand

00093

1   what you think the panel really meant, and you don't

2   need to have a motion or need to vote on a motion

3   related to that.  We've got the point.

4   So in terms of following the process, I

5   kind of agree with Bob.  If everything I have heard,

6   if I understand everything I've heard, the motion

7   should be not to ratify number 4.B, ratify everything

8   else and leave it at that.

9   DR. SOX:  A comment on Bob's suggestion

10   and Sean's comment?

11   DR. GARBER:  Well, I think Bob's

12   suggestion has a lot of merit and strictly speaking,

13   that might be what we should do procedurally.  And

14   the reason that my proposal is different is simply

15   that I don't believe this is a case where we are

16   really second guessing the panel.  I think that there

17   is an internal contradiction in what the panel did,

18   that it's revealed in the minutes and in the

19   transcript.  We are not trying to relook at the data

20   or anything of the sort.  It's just that the panel

21   had difficulty reaching a conclusion and they ended

22   up voting on a motion that seems, they ended up

23   voting in a direction that seems contradicted by the

24   discussion.

25   And we could either throw it back to them,

00094

1   but this, my motion and the amended language was

2   intended to preserve what we thought was the spirit

3   of their discussion, and I don't think this requires

4   going back to the committee if what Barbara says is

5   true, and I would tend to believe her, that the panel

6   would have been quite comfortable with this

7   substituted language.  I think that this process has

8   to move things forward in a timely fashion, we have

9   heard that over and over again, and to simply say

10   throw this out because they didn't follow procedures,

11   I think would not be that helpful at this point, even

12   though I have the same reservations that Bob has

13   about the failure to follow the guidelines that the

14   Executive Committee recommended.

15   So I don't really see this as a slap in

16   their face as much as a way to try to refine the

17   recommendation that resulted from their discussions.

18   And of course I think we should do what's helpful to

19   HCFA, or to CMS, excuse me, but I still stand by this

20   amended form, which I think moves the process forward

21   and more clearly reflects the intent of the panel.

22   DR. SOX:  I would just like to point out

23   that this committee in the past hasn't been shy at

24   all about disapproving recommendations of panels and

25   sending them back for reconsideration, so we have

00095

1   done that, and we'll do it again if we're given a

2   chance.

3   Now, we have a motion before the group and

4   rather than talk and talk and talk, I would like any

5   discussion to be directed at Alan's motion, which I

6   think we need to repeat just to get us back on

7   target, and we need to discuss that, we don't need to

8   start new things until we express our opinion as a

9   group about whether that captures our views on the

10   subject that we have just been discussing.  So, could

11   you reread the motion?

12   MS. ANDERSON:  Here's what I have.  The

13   motion is to approve all recommendations of the

14   Diagnostic Imaging Panel except number 4, and amend

15   the question number 4 to state, is it likely that PET

16   improves health outcomes when used as an adjunct to

17   standard staging tests in detecting locoregional

18   recurrence or distant metastases recurrence for some

19   patients when results from other tests are

20   inconclusive.

21   DR. SOX:  That's the motion.  We're going

22   to talk about that motion.  We're not going to

23   introduce any new ideas until we express our opinion

24   about this motion.  So now, discussion on the motion.

25   Mike.

00096

1   DR. MAVES:  I have some concerns about

2   this, only because Bob made one other comment.  He

3   said this is a legal process and as we're finding

4   out, words do matter.  I guess maybe a question to

5   Sean would be, does a change in language from is

6   there advocate evidence to is it likely, would that

7   perhaps dictate a change in how HCFA or CMS would

8   consider covering this particular clinical situation.

9   It would seem to me that's a weakening of position

10   and so again, the words could matter and you might

11   want to have the committee look at this again.

12   DR. TUNIS:  You know, my honest answer to

13   that is no, it wouldn't change how HCFA, you could

14   change the words and it wouldn't change where we

15   would be obligated to or inclined to go.  Again, I

16   would just say on that point, what CMS pays great

17   attention to is not just these recommendations on the

18   vote, but the logic and the discussion that go around

19   them, and I think I would say that we have a pretty

20   clear sense of where this discussion is going and

21   changing the words or however these motions come out

22   isn't going to affect that.

23   DR. SOX:  Thank you, Sean.  Yes, Bob?

24   DR. MURRAY:  I believe the question has

25   been adequately discussed, and request that the

00097

1   chairman call the question.

2   DR. SOX:  Call the question.

3   MS. ANDERSON:  All voting for the motion?

4   All voting against?  No abstentions.

5   DR. HOLOHAN:  Yes, I abstain.

6   MS. ANDERSON:  Oh, one abstention.  The

7   vote carries.

8   DR. SOX:  So, we have just approved the

9   recommendations of the panel with the exception of

10   4.B, where we approved the substituted language

11   indicated here.  I think that we're done.

12   DR. MCNEIL:  It would be nice.  I'm sure

13   that the committee wasn't anxious to come back to

14   this question and discuss it once more.

15   DR. SOX:  Bob, did you have a question?

16   DR. MURRAY:  I have a question, if I

17   could.  This is a question to Barbara and it does not

18   change the vote, doesn't change anything, it is just

19   something to put in the record for clarification.

20   And if you cannot answer the question in 25 words or

21   less then I withdraw the question.

22   The last clause is, when results from

23   other tests are inconclusive and I focus on the word

24   inconclusive.  Did the panel think of inconclusive as

25   meaning an inadequate study that is for technical

00098

1   reasons, the MRI could not be done, the scan whatever

2   was just technically inadequate, or was the panel

3   thinking of inconclusive meaning the study, the bone

4   scan was technically perfect, it gave a clear result,

5   but it does not give the oncologist 100 percent

6   certainty on the diagnosis, and therefore I want to

7   add one more test, one more bit of evidence.  So was

8   it, does inconclusive mean technically inadequate or

9   interpretationally insufficient?

10   DR. MCNEIL:  It was not the former, it was

11   the latter, and the example that Rich Wahl gave about

12   an MRI in which it was impossible to differentiate

13   radiation fibrosis from new disease or recurring

14   disease is the best example I can think of.  The

15   study was perfect, the findings because of previous

16   therapy just didn't allow the interpreter to make an

17   exact diagnosis.

18   DR. MURRAY:  Thank you.

19   DR. TUNIS:  Barbara, I have one more

20   question for you with the same 25 words or less

21   caveat.

22   DR. MCNEIL:  Boy, this is tough.

23   DR. TUNIS:  It seems to me that on this

24   series of questions that the panel addressed, in a

25   couple of cases, for example on the use in staging

00099

1   the axillary lymph nodes, it seems to me that my

2   sense of the panel's conclusion was that the evidence

3   was adequate to determine that PET was not useful,

4   whereas in number 5 in terms of use in monitoring

5   response to therapy, the conclusion was there is

6   inadequate evidence to make a determination about

7   whether it is or isn't useful.

8   It's a critical point for us because as

9   you know, the structure of the coverage decision at

10   least as of last December, you know, a voice that CMS

11   would be inclined to cover within a cancer even if

12   there is inconclusive evidence for some indications,

13   as long as at least one indication is considered

14   adequately supported, except for applications or uses

15   within that cancer for which the evidence is adequate

16   to conclude that it's not useful.  And so for example

17   my sense is, and again I'm going back to using the

18   axilla, that PET was shown not to be adequately

19   sensitive to use for that clinical purpose, which

20   might lead us to a noncoverage for that specific use,

21   but for something like monitoring response to therapy

22   where the evidence was inadequate, we might come to a

23   different coverage determination, so it's important

24   to know what the committee meant by those negative

25   votes.

00100

1   DR. MCNEIL:  Okay, I think you actually

2   had it right.  I think we felt for the original three

3   questions, whatever it was, the data were not there,

4   that where I indicated that the -- in many cases the

5   data was there but because of the issue of

6   undertreatment for example, that there were no data

7   to suggest, the data did not suggest the use of PET

8   in those circumstances would improve health outcomes.

9   So you're right, say for the axillary nodes in

10   particular, there were data, and because of the

11   sensitivity and the specificity of the tests in those

12   circumstances, more harm than good would be done by

13   using the test and we thought that the data, there

14   were a lot of studies for those indications.

15   When we got to the question of tumor

16   response, which is what you're asking, which was the

17   last one, I think people agreed that it was promising

18   and important but the data were not there, that is to

19   say, the data showed in one study, I don't have

20   the -- or two studies actually, from two studies the

21   data showed that there would be undertreatment in the

22   range of 10 to 20 percent, 10 to 17 percent, so those

23   data showed that there would be undertreatment of

24   patients by using this test for that purpose.  But

25   those were only two studies.

00101

1   And there was another earlier study that

2   was well done, I believe Rich Wahl had done it from

3   Michigan, I think Michigan, in which the

4   chemotherapeutic agents that were being evaluated

5   aren't the ones that are currently --

6   DR. WAHL:  That's not completely accurate.

7   DR. MCNEIL:  Right, but what was studied

8   is not exactly what is being done today.

9   DR. WAHL:  But I thought the committee

10   thought it was very promising because there were

11   three or four studies also (inaudible).

12   DR. MCNEIL:  And there was the risk of

13   undertreatment from those same patients.  So I don't

14   know if that answers your question.  There were false

15   positives and false positives from the data that we

16   have, and I guess the answer to your question would

17   depend on how much you weight the results associated

18   with errors in each of those directions.

19   DR. SOX:  Well, we're going to take a

20   15-minute break at this point before coming back to

21   discuss L-carnitine.

22   (Recess from 10:56 to 11:17 a.m.)

23   DR. SOX:  We are now going to commence

24   discussion of the findings of the Drugs, Biological

25   and Therapeutics Panel on the use of L-carnitine

00102

1   injections in patients with end-stage renal disease,

2   and Dr. Holohan, the chair of that panel, is going to

3   summarize their findings.

4   DR. HOLOHAN:  Good morning.  Dr. Sox

5   provided a critique of the absence of a written

6   summary of the panel's findings and conclusions, and

7   to that I plead not guilty.  I had decided, Barbara

8   and I will both do an apologia pro vita sua in this

9   case.

10   DR. MCNEIL:  I wasn't that literate

11   though.

12   DR. HOLOHAN:  We decided to wait for the

13   transcripts of the panel, and that September would be

14   plenty of time to get this done and distributed to

15   the panel for their review.  As some of you know, the

16   statutory assignment of the Veterans Administration

17   is to act as a back-up for DoD in national

18   emergencies, and that has eliminated all of my

19   discretionary time, so I will present this verbally.

20   You have the summary of the meeting

21   minutes and you will note, those of you who are

22   perceptive, that there was an additional member

23   replacing the person who couldn't attend.  That

24   additional member was Dr. Emil Paganini, who is a

25   nephrologist, who is a member of the MCAC, and he sat

00103

1   in on our panel.  He is a nephrologist at the

2   Cleveland Clinic.

3   Probably the most significant point to

4   make is that the questions as initially posed to this

5   panel were, is there adequate evidence that

6   administration of intravenous L-carnitine is

7   effective as a therapy to improve clinical conditions

8   or outcomes in patients with end-stage renal diseases

9   on hemodialysis?

10   And question number 2, is there adequate

11   evidence that the administration of intravenous

12   L-carnitine is effective on clinical conditions or

13   outcomes in patients with end-stage renal disease on

14   hemodialysis?  The specific clinical conditions were

15   fairly broad and included anemia, disorders of lipid

16   metabolism, cardiac dysfunction, muscle strength and

17   asthenia.

18   And question 2.B was the same question for

19   the oral form.  I emphasize that because in fact the

20   panel determined based on the testimony, the evidence

21   and the reviews of the published material provided

22   that those questions could not be answered on the

23   basis of adequate evidence, so they chose to answer

24   different questions.

25   I will stand for correction from my

00104

1   esteemed panel member at any time he so chooses to

2   correct a statement I make.

3   Initially a presentation was made for the

4   entire panel from a Dr. Chertow, who was a

5   nephrologist from the University of California San

6   Francisco and who is very active in developing

7   guidelines published under the pneumonic K-DOQI,

8   kidney dialysis outcomes quality initiative, a

9   multidisciplinary cross-specialty group of

10   specialists in end-stage renal disease.  And they

11   actually addressed a year ago the use of L-carnitine

12   for maintenance dialysis patients.

13   And what Dr. Chertow said, and I'm quoting

14   from their publication on the K-DOQI nutrition and

15   chronic renal failure document, there are

16   insufficient data to support the routine use of

17   L-carnitine for maintenance dialysis patients.  So

18   this group felt there were insufficient data to

19   support its routine use for any of the proposed

20   clinical disorders that I have mentioned above.

21   A review of literature was done by HCFA,

22   by myself, and by Miss Dooley, the industry

23   representative on the panel.  The alleged benefits in

24   the published studies, and you should have been given

25   a matrix of the summary of published studies for each

00105

1   of the alleged clinical indications, allege that

2   benefits from L-carnitine were observed in decreased

3   asthenia, fatigue, cramps, decreased muscle strength.

4   That L-carnitine improved the lipid profile, it

5   improved anemia, improved cardiac symptoms, and

6   reduced arrhythmias.

7   In sum, a review of all of the material

8   provided by HCFA and additional material provided by

9   the manufacturer was not compelling to the panel.

10   There were a number of problems with these studies.

11   In general, the sample sizes were very small.  The

12   L-carnitine used was begin orally, intravenously and

13   in dialysate in a mixed fashion across the studies.

14   For every measure, every group of signs and symptoms

15   that I have described, the results in any one cluster

16   were positive, negative or no change.  There were no

17   group of signs and symptoms where the predominant

18   evidence was of a benefit.

19   Even within the individual studies, not

20   all measures were used on all patients.  Many of the

21   studies showed positive results based on post hoc

22   analyses, secondary statistical analyses of the data.

23   Very few of the studies addressed serum levels of

24   L-carnitine in patients who were so treated.  And

25   this is important.  And I will get to the FDA letter

00106

1   that was distributed to you when I discuss the panel

2   deliberations.

3   The panel concluded that the questions

4   that I have read as posed by HCFA could not be

5   answered, and one of the major reasons was elaborated

6   in the letter from the Food and Drug Administration,

7   and I will cite just a few sentences from their

8   approval of this drug for intravenous use in ESRD

9   patients for the prevention and treatment of

10   carnitine deficiency.

11   The FDA said, clinical manifestations of

12   carnitine deficiency generally do not ensue until

13   levels fall to less than 20 percent of normal.  They

14   go on to say that the data support the efficacy of

15   intravenous levo-carnitine in increasing, maintaining

16   or increasing carnitine serum levels.  However, they

17   do not support improvements in clinical status or

18   exercise tolerance, not do they provide convincing

19   evidence for decreases in BUN, creatinine,

20   phosphorus, for increases in hematocrit, decreases in

21   hypotensive episodes.

22   So basically the panel was on the horns of

23   a dilemma.  They could not answer the first question

24   posed by HCFA, i.e., is there adequate evidence that

25   the administration of L-carnitine is effective in

00107

1   clinical conditions or outcomes in patients with ESRD

2   on hemodialysis because the FDA document clearly

3   indicated that on the basis of the information

4   provided by the manufacturer, the FDA was only

5   willing to say that it was effective in maintaining

6   or increasing carnitine levels.  Few if any of the

7   studies directly related serum carnitine levels to

8   carnitine administration and improvement in the

9   alleged outcomes.

10   So the panel was not confident that in

11   fact carnitine deficiency, although they believe it

12   existed, was defined in the published literature.

13   They went back and recalled some of the people who

14   gave testimony, specifically asking the question

15   about a definition of carnitine deficiency, and did

16   not receive a definition satisfactory to them.

17   At the same time they believed that the

18   published data did include studies that showed that a

19   subpopulation of patients did in fact appear to

20   benefit, that is, they had either improvement in

21   clinical status or decrease in signs and symptoms

22   associated, putatively associated with carnitine

23   deficiency.

24   Because of that, their recommendations as

25   written in the copy of the minutes you have received

00108

1   were three.  First, they recommended that CMS or HCFA

2   establish a mechanism to define carnitine deficiency

3   in the ESRD patient population, because they believed

4   that the published studies were adequate to show that

5   such a condition exists.

6   Secondly, they concluded there was

7   adequate evidence that indicated some patients

8   benefit from levo-carnitine but that these couldn't

9   be identified either prospectively or retrospectively

10   from the published data.  They recommended that

11   Medicare establish rational guidelines that could

12   identify this patient population.  That again was a

13   unanimous vote.

14   The panel did believe that the published

15   information was adequate to conclude that there was

16   no evidence that the route of administration,

17   intravenous, oral or put in dialysis fluid, was

18   likely to be or could be an important factor in the

19   use of L-carnitine therapy.

20   The issue of clinical safety did not

21   appear in any of the published literature but the

22   manufacturer testified that they believed that the

23   oral form uniquely could be metabolized to

24   potentially toxic metabolites and they were asking

25   the FDA to insert such a warning in the label of the

00109

1   oral form of carnitine.  At that time and to my

2   current knowledge, the FDA has not done so.

3   So again, in summary, the panel concluded

4   that it was appropriate for CMS to establish a

5   mechanism to develop a definition of carnitine

6   deficiency in the ESRD patient population.  That

7   there was evidence that some patients benefitted from

8   the administration of levo-carnitine in any dosage

9   form and that Medicare coverage, and I don't know if

10   this in fact is something we're legally able to do,

11   but the panel concluded that Medicare coverage should

12   be provided upon establishment of rational guidelines

13   that identify the patient population.  And finally

14   concluded that the route of administration does not

15   appear to be a relevant factor in any benefits that

16   may accrue from exogenous levo-carnitine.

17   DR. SOX:  Thank you very much,

18   Dr. Holohan.  We next we will go on to comments from

19   members of the audience.  We don't have any scheduled

20   public comment, but if anybody here would like to go

21   to the microphone and make a comment, they should do

22   so.  Be sure to identify yourself, your affiliation

23   and anything we need to know that might help us to

24   interpret your work, like potential conflicts.

25   MR. MEHRLING:  I'm Ken Merlin, the chief

00110

1   operating officer for Sigma Tau, who is the

2   manufacturer of Carnitor, and I just wanted to state

3   that the package insert has been changed to include

4   the precaution of extended periods of time using high

5   doses of oral carnitine is not recommended in

6   patients with severely limited renal function.  That

7   is in the current package insert, which has happened

8   after our meeting.

9   DR. SOX:  Thank you very much.

10   DR. HOLOHAN:  Did you happen to bring

11   copies.

12   MR. MEHRLING:  I can have them provided.

13   DR. SOX:  Does anybody else wish to go to

14   the microphone to comment?  In that case, it's time

15   for members of the committee to discuss these three

16   motions and I think just to try to be systematic

17   about this we will go through them one by one.  The

18   first one is, CMS to establish a mechanism to define

19   carnitine deficiency in the ESRD patient population,

20   because there is adequate evidence that such a

21   condition exists.

22   Would anybody like to raise questions

23   about this, or clarification, because we're going to

24   be asked ultimately to approve this statement?

25   Maybe I could ask a question, Tom.  When

00111

1   you said establish a mechanism, what were you

2   thinking about, a blood test or something like that?

3   DR. HOLOHAN:  No.  In fact the belief, and

4   I stand able for correction if I misinterpret the

5   panel's concept, I think the panel believed that in

6   fact carnitine deficiency can and probably does exist

7   in some patients who are end-stage renal disease

8   patients.  At the present time, there is no mechanism

9   based on the testimony or the available published

10   evidence that could identify and define carnitine

11   deficiency.

12   The FDA defined it to a limited extent in

13   their approval letter when they said the clinical

14   symptoms are unlikely to occur below a serum level of

15   20 percent, but serum levels were not represented in

16   the published evidence.  So I think the panel was

17   encouraging the CAg to bring together a group of

18   experts in end-stage renal disease and nephrology to

19   help define for purposes of coverage determination

20   exactly what is meant by carnitine deficiency.

21   I don't want to keep going on, but many of

22   the published papers presumed that signs and symptoms

23   that patients have were ipso facto due to carnitine

24   deficiency and the panel was very uncomfortable with

25   accepting that.

00112

1   DR. SOX:  So you're basically calling for

2   somebody to come up with a case definition that can

3   be used not just for coverage, but for studying the

4   problem and identifying who has it.

5   DR. HOLOHAN:  Yes.

6   DR. SOX:  Bob?

7   DR. BROOK:  I am trying to put your

8   recommendations together with the letter from David

9   Orloffi, from the FDA.  Let me see if I understand

10   this issue as clearly as I can.  Some people are

11   going to get this condition, everyone agrees, and

12   there is obviously data that somebody is going to get

13   this condition, if nothing else, through losses under

14   dialysis.  I mean, that's the first sentence of his

15   statement.

16   DR. HOLOHAN:  No, he says can.

17   DR. BROOK:  Yes, some, that's what I'm

18   saying, some people will get this.

19   DR. HOLOHAN:  No, he doesn't say some

20   will, he says patients can.  I don't see that as the

21   same thing.

22   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  So some people can get

23   this.

24   DR. HOLOHAN:  Yes.

25   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  They've also defined

00113

1   the level, they consider that you don't get clinical

2   manifestations of this deficiency unless the level

3   falls to less than 20 percent of normal.

4   DR. HOLOHAN:  That's what he says.

5   DR. BROOK:  Now your first statement said,

6   CMS should establish a mechanism to define it.  Does

7   that mean you didn't find evidence to accept that

8   definition?

9   DR. HOLOHAN:  No.  What I tried to convey,

10   perhaps inefficiently, was that few of the studies,

11   and if you want the precise numbers I can get them

12   for you, but few, a dramatic minority of the studies

13   actually measured serum levels.  Most of the

14   published data presumed that signs and symptoms that

15   patients had were due to carnitine deficiency and

16   they were either given carnitine in a case control

17   study, a cohort, a randomized trial, but serum levels

18   were not available to us.

19   DR. BROOK:  Let me see if I can follow.

20   Why did the panel not just say, instead of CMS should

21   establish a mechanism, why didn't they just adopt the

22   mechanism suggested in this letter?

23   DR. HOLOHAN:  They were not comfortable

24   doing that.  Bob, do you want to make any additional

25   comments as to why?

00114

1   DR. BROOK:  But it was discussed and

2   people weren't comfortable, so there needs to be --

3   DR. HOLOHAN:  It was discussed and the

4   panelists brought up some of the people who testified

5   back to the microphone to ask them specific questions

6   about whether they would accept a specific serum

7   level, and there was general unwillingness among the

8   people testifying, nephrologists and spokespersons

9   for disease groups, to accept a serum level.

10   DR. BROOK:  So what guidance would you

11   give CMS right now to carry out, number one, how

12   would they do it, or that's up to them?

13   DR. HOLOHAN:  I think we -- well, you will

14   have to ask Sean what his view was.  I think the

15   believe of the panel was that HCFA, CMS should bring

16   together a group of people with expertise in this,

17   some of whom testified, and develop a consensus on a

18   definition of carnitine deficiency.  That could be

19   simply serum levels or it could be combinations of

20   serum levels and signs and symptoms, but probably not

21   just the presence of signs and symptoms.

22   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  Now can I just ask one

23   other question.  Regarding number 2, there is another

24   really very strong statement in this letter from the

25   FDA, it would be therefore, unethical to subject

00115

1   patients to the risk and discomforts of frank

2   carnitine deficiency in a study designed to assess

3   the clinical benefit of supplementation because of

4   the safety of supplementation.

5   DR. HOLOHAN:  Okay.

6   DR. BROOK:  So when you said, and when you

7   reviewed these studies and showed that in all

8   patients in ESRD, the routine use shows, you made a

9   comment that there was no evidence to support that

10   routine use would benefit people with any of these

11   outcomes.

12   DR. HOLOHAN:  That's what the Kidney

13   Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative said.

14   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  Now what I don't --

15   DR. HOLOHAN:  The panel concluded that on

16   the basis of the published data, one could not

17   conclude with any at degree of certainty that

18   supplementation with levo-carnitine in any form, PO,

19   IV or in the dialysate, significantly improved the

20   clusters and groups of signs and symptoms that had

21   been alleged by the authors of those papers to be due

22   to carnitine deficiency, i.e., anemia, weakness,

23   asthenia, cramps.

24   DR. BROOK:  Could not?

25   DR. HOLOHAN:  Correct.

00116

1   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  So when you say there

2   is adequate evidence that some people benefit, the

3   language in here is it would be unethical to take --

4   there's go to be in this population a group of people

5   can develop, so you say number one, that there are

6   people, and so if you have these people in this

7   population, presumably they would benefit from

8   supplementation, but what is the evidence?  Is the

9   evidence based on animal models?  What is the

10   evidence based upon, because here it says it's

11   unethical to randomize people.  What --

12   DR. HOLOHAN:  I agree with that, but I

13   don't see anything about randomizing people.

14   DR. BROOK:  No.  You say there's adequate

15   evidence.  And you just said that the studies didn't

16   show that, and so what I'm indicating is where does

17   that evidence come from?

18   DR. SOX:  Well, let's -- I'm trying --

19   Bob, if you could defer that question until we get

20   through the first one.

21   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  I was just trying to

22   put them together in some sense.

23   DR. HOLOHAN:  I think I can answer that

24   quickly.  When I was summarizing the clinical trials,

25   I pointed out that the panel concluded that in some

00117

1   of the trials there appeared to be a subgroup of

2   patients, mostly identifiable retrospectively, that

3   did appear to have significant improvements in signs

4   and symptoms, be it anemia, muscle weakness,

5   asthenia, cramps.  The panel believed, most of the

6   panel believed that in fact there was a strong

7   suggestion that there may be a minority, a subgroup

8   of patients who might benefit that at the present

9   time cannot be easily prospectively identified.

10   DR. SOX:  Dr. Whyte is going to try to

11   provide some information to help us.

12   DR. WHYTE:  I'm John Whyte.  I'm one of

13   the physicians in the coverage group.  What I wanted

14   to clarify on point one was Dr. Holohan had mentioned

15   how there was modification of the questions that we

16   originally presented to the panel, and we were not

17   planning to ask as one of the questions, how do we

18   define carnitine deficiency, so we did not provide

19   information as to what we would consider carnitine

20   deficiency.

21   So that's why you may see the panel

22   talking about that they do not feel that there was

23   adequate evidence to define carnitine deficiency and

24   that would have been because we didn't provide that

25   information.

00118

1   We have had multiple discussions with the

2   FDA as well as others, and I am not prepared today to

3   talk where we are in decision making, but certainly

4   we feel at a staff level that we have enough

5   information to define carnitine deficiency.  So I

6   just wanted to provide as background the reason why

7   you may have this point is because we didn't provide

8   the information, because we weren't planning to

9   answer that question.

10   DR. HOLOHAN:  Right.  I think, just to

11   elaborate, the panelists believed that most of the

12   published data presumed that because patients were on

13   chronic dialysis and it was not unreasonable to

14   believe that you can remove carnitine in

15   hemodialysis, there was a presumption on the part of

16   the authors of the papers that in fact the patients

17   subject to their study had carnitine deficiency.  And

18   in looking at the totality of the evidence, the panel

19   was unwilling to make that leap of fate, particularly

20   in view of the FDA approval letter that talked about

21   a serum level which rarely appeared in any of the

22   published studies.

23   DR. SOX:  Alan?

24   DR. GARBER:  I think one of the reasons

25   this is a little bit hard to sort through is first of

00119

1   all, I think the recommendation 1 should be subsumed

2   under recommendation 2, that is, identifying

3   subgroups who would benefit.  The issue is not really

4   whether the carnitine deficiency per se causes the

5   symptoms; the issue is does carnitine supplementation

6   help these symptoms.  And from what Tom has said, it

7   may not be that clear that you can use the carnitine

8   level to determine who is most likely to benefit.  It

9   may be there should be some other selection criteria,

10   and to answer number 1, that CMS should develop

11   criteria based on carnitine is to presuppose that the

12   carnitine level defines the subgroups who benefit.

13   And given that some of these trials didn't

14   even measure the carnitine level, not to mention that

15   they didn't clearly and consistently demonstrate

16   benefit, it seems to be jumping too quickly to a

17   conclusion that carnitine is the issue.

18   And I have to admit, I am also confused by

19   the FDA letter, where it says the clinical

20   manifestations do not ensue until levels fall to less

21   than 20 percent of normal, but then the clinical team

22   leader's note at the bottom basically says that there

23   is no evidence that carnitine supplementation

24   improves symptoms, what it does is raise carnitine

25   levels.  So how they, the FDA has given a rather

00120

1   tepid approval to this, saying that it's like giving

2   sodium may raise serum sodium levels if there is some

3   problem with your auto regulation.

4   But it seems to me the first question has

5   to be number 2, and I don't see how CMS can be

6   expected to develop carnitine criteria unless they

7   know that the carnitine level defines subgroups who

8   would benefit.

9   DR. WHYTE:  I don't disagree with that

10   statement.  The only point that I wanted to make was

11   to make sure people knew, part of the reason why they

12   didn't have adequate evidence addressing point 1 is

13   because we didn't provide that information, and

14   that's the point that I wanted to make clear.

15   DR. GARBER:  But does it exist?

16   DR. WHYTE:  There is a body of literature

17   that discusses exactly those points that you talked

18   about.  We didn't provide all of that information to

19   the panel, because that originally was not one of the

20   issues that the panel was going to address.

21   DR. SOX:  Any other discussion on the

22   first item?  I hope nobody is planning on rewriting

23   these recommendations too severely, unless it really

24   looks important.

25   Let's go on then to number 2, there is

00121

1   adequate evidence that indicates that some patients

2   benefit from L-carnitine.  Upon establishment of

3   rational guidelines that identify this patient

4   population, Medicare coverage should be provided.

5   Speaking for myself in reviewing the HCFA

6   review of all that evidence, I was hard pressed to, I

7   was surprised to see this statement, because it

8   looked to me as if studies weren't consistent in

9   their results, the effect size were relatively small,

10   as you already pointed out, Tom, studies often

11   involved relatively few patients, and so I thought,

12   I'm surprised that the panel actually made this

13   statement.  So maybe you would like to comment on

14   that and there may be other things that we will also

15   want to talk about with this statement, but let's

16   start with that one.

17   DR. HOLOHAN:  Well, I'm not going to

18   philosophically disagree with you, but let me put

19   myself in the loafers of one of the panel members or

20   any of the panel members.  If you look at the chart

21   on the effect of carnitine on EPO requirements, I

22   only found three studies that were fairly recently

23   published, and one showed no change, but two showed

24   EPO requirements decreasing, in one case in 8 of 19

25   experimental group of patients, and in the second

00122

1   study EPO requirements decreasing in 7 of 13.  I

2   believe that the panel members concluded from these,

3   and studies in your charts on exercise capacity and

4   strength, asthenia symptoms, et cetera, that there

5   could be a pony under all of this other material, and

6   that perhaps if patients were selected well

7   prospectively, you could have identified which 8 of

8   the 19 did in fact benefit from levo-carnitine.

9   I think there were enough studies where

10   small proportions of patients showed in some cases

11   not unimpressive improvements in either hematocrit,

12   exercise capacity, reduction in fatigue, et cetera,

13   and they were unwilling to cast aside the possibility

14   that there was a potentially identifiable group of

15   patients who might benefit.

16   Have I misstated the belief of the panel?

17   DR. MURRAY:  I wasn't there.

18   DR HOLOHAN:  Oh, I'm sorry.

19   DR. FRANCIS:  I wasn't there, but can I

20   just understand this.  There was adequate evidence

21   that someone benefits but inadequate evidence as to

22   which patients those are, or inadequate evidence

23   about our ability to identify prospectively?

24   DR. HOLOHAN:  I have read through the

25   transcript several times and I don't think anybody on

00123

1   the panel ever quite phrased it that way.  I think

2   they believed that the published data included

3   studies that showed that small proportions of

4   patients showed a benefit, that the data were

5   insufficient to conclude that it should routinely be

6   used on all ESRD patients, but maybe, just maybe it's

7   possible to identify prospectively those people who

8   would benefit.  Maybe this benefit in 7 out of 13

9   wasn't just chance.

10   DR. SOX:  Wade, I think you were next.

11   DR. AUBRY:  I'm a little bit confused

12   about the dosages, and maybe this is sort of getting

13   ahead of the question, but if the panel is making a

14   recommendation on coverage, that would include not

15   only patient selection criteria but also some

16   recommendations for dosage.  It seems like these

17   studies have quite a variability of dosage.

18   DR. HOLOHAN:  You are a master of

19   understatement.

20   DR. AUBRY:  And so I'm totally unclear as

21   to what would be an appropriate, you know,

22   therapeutic dose.  Even these EPO studies show

23   variability.

24   DR. SOX:  Alan, I think you were next.

25   DR. GARBER:  Well, I don't think that the

00124

1   fact that only 8 of 19 or 7 of 13 benefitted means

2   that this has to be targeted.  If this is an

3   important benefit to reduce EPO requirements, then

4   these studies seem to establish it.  So I don't think

5   we could hope to in every study to find the subgroup

6   that has the greatest benefit.  The question is, is

7   this statistically significant and if the answer is

8   yes, well, this is related to that question, was this

9   the primary end point for these studies, and do we

10   take this seriously and were there offsetting adverse

11   effect.

12   But the issue in interpreting these

13   studies, yes, these were significant and yes, there

14   was a prospectively defined end point, and there were

15   not offsetting adverse effects, then the real issue

16   becomes how do you duplicate the population that was

17   entered in these studies, not so much how do you find

18   the subgroups within the study that got the greatest

19   benefit.  Because 50 percent of the people got a

20   reduction and the mean reduction was about a third

21   for the experimental group, so that sounds like a

22   fairly large reduction if you think EPO requirements

23   is an important end point.

24   DR. SOX:  Other comments?  Sean.

25   DR. TUNIS:  This is sort of related to

00125

1   Alan's point on the EPO requirements, but also

2   Dr. Holohan wanted to clarify with you was that the

3   original questions that were posed to the panel

4   actually broke down into the specific indications of

5   whether there was adequate evidence that

6   supplementation was effective in EPO resistant anemia

7   and fatigue, in muscle cramps, et cetera,

8   individually broken down; is that right, John?

9   DR. WHYTE:  That's correct.

10   DR. TUNIS:  So I believe again, correct me

11   if I'm wrong, but I believe that the panel decided

12   not to answer those questions specifically because in

13   part they felt that taken individually, for no single

14   indication did they feel that the evidence met this

15   adequacy criteria.  And again, I'm posing that as a

16   question as opposed to, because that's my

17   recollection, including the review of the evidence on

18   EPO resistant anemia.  Tom, is that your

19   recollection, or anyone else?

20   DR. HOLOHAN:  It is.

21   DR. TUNIS:  So I think that then, that's

22   what led to sort of the second recommendation of the

23   panel which is while no individual indication did

24   they feel that the evidence rose to the level of

25   adequacy, they felt that in aggregate there was

00126

1   something there.  I don't know if anyone talked about

2   a pony specifically, but that there was something

3   there.  And that's my own recollection of the

4   discussion, but if John or anyone else from Sigma Tau

5   or others had a different view, we should hear about

6   that as well.

7   DR. BROOK:  I'm a little confused.  Why

8   did the panel not just answer the questions no and

9   then go on to other -- I'm trying to deal with

10   process here and improve the process.  There were a

11   few questions that were posed.  It sounds like you

12   answered no to the evidence questions that Sean just

13   talked about; is that correct?

14   DR. HOLOHAN:  Yes.

15   DR. BROOK:  Why are they not in the

16   recommendations of the panel?  Why did the panel not

17   vote on them?

18   DR. TUNIS:  I think the panel asked not to

19   vote on them.

20   DR. BROOK:  Well, I'm really wondering

21   about the process.  We're being asked to provide an

22   advisory function to HCFA.  I mean, I thought Rand

23   was the only person that came in and changed the

24   entire question and context, and then wondered why we

25   never got any business.

00127

1   (Laughter.)

2   I mean, the question here is that we're

3   asked to answer some questions, and I'm being serious

4   about this.  Is there part of the minutes of this

5   thing that ought to be brought forth in the summary

6   here of what was proposed, that would state that

7   either the panel did not -- it was obvious by intent

8   or consent that the evidence wasn't there to answer

9   any of these questions, and therefore we can be

10   confident that the answers to the original questions

11   that CMS proposed is no.

12   DR. TUNIS:  Well, let me just make one

13   comment in terms of the process, and maybe someone

14   can answer the question about the sense of the

15   minutes.  But if you recall, there was a previous

16   episode in which CMS diligently stuck to the

17   questions and forced the panel to answer them with an

18   unsatisfactory result as well, which was that the

19   panel sort of rebelled or made their feelings known

20   in terms of the feeling that the questions were too

21   constrained.  Maybe this is deviation too far in the

22   other direction, but the feeling was we had a bad

23   result from forcing questions on the panel that they

24   felt in some way --

25   DR. BROOK:  I'm not arguing that they

00128

1   can't answer other questions, but we saw the problem

2   that occurs when you begin to answer other questions

3   if the evidence has not been summarized.

4   DR. TUNIS:  Right.

5   DR. BROOK:  And what I'm trying to get at

6   is the process here but before we get -- the first

7   issue here was, it sounds like they came close to

8   suggesting that the questions, regardless of whether

9   they're good or bad questions, there was not evidence

10   to answer them, and the evidence was insufficient.

11   DR. TUNIS:  That's my recollection, again.

12   Tom, do you want to talk about that?

13   DR. BROOK:  And then John said that in

14   answer to question number 1, which the panel

15   recommended, he was concerned to get on the record

16   that the reason that there may be, there may be more

17   evidence to answer question 1 than currently the

18   panel had available when they deliberated.  And I

19   just want to, I mean, there seems to be a process

20   problem here.  I have no problem with these

21   recommendations.  I mean what I'm trying to get at is

22   the process problem.

23   Now on recommendation 2, I have another

24   question.  If they voted that there is adequate

25   evidence that some patients would benefit, don't they

00129

1   need to state as they did on the first panel, the

2   other panel, what's that based upon.  It sounds like

3   it's based upon hunches that within the trials there

4   are subgroups of people that seem to benefit, but

5   there was not a subgroup statistically specific

6   analysis to support that, but there is clinical logic

7   to support that, and that's the reason that they

8   concluded that there is adequate evidence.  I mean, I

9   am just trying to lay out what the rationale, what

10   they believe the level of evidence or effectiveness

11   was in terms of to say that there is adequate

12   evidence.

13   DR. HOLOHAN:  Let me read a few statements

14   from our designated nephrologist panel member that

15   may give you a flavor of that.  Dr. Paganini says, I

16   have been sort of impressed and unimpressed straight

17   through.  I came in with a fairly open mind.  In the

18   clinic where I practice there are some folks who use

19   it and some folks who don't, and it seems to be used

20   mostly in subgroups of patients that are on dialysis

21   that you tried everything else and why not try this.

22   In reviewing the literature, I was relatively

23   unimpressed with the outcomes that were purported.

24   However, he goes on to say in a discussion

25   with one of the people testifying, no, I think what

00130

1   I'm trying to do, honestly, Joel, is I think that

2   carnitine may in fact have some significant

3   improvement effect in some patients, and I'm trying

4   to get a handle on who those patients are.  And by

5   what you listed here, and I know this is not supposed

6   to be a debate, but what you listed here, I can list

7   for just about all the patients I have ever come in

8   contact with on dialysis, and yet the literature

9   doesn't seem to support that.  So I'm just trying to

10   get a handle on who that subgroup might be that would

11   truly benefit and whether or not there is information

12   out there.

13   DR. BROOK:  Did anyone question why the

14   FDA said it would be unethical to actually do a study

15   to answer the question, to find a subgroup?  This

16   statement says that -- I mean, if this went through a

17   human substance committee, we are in deep doo-doo,

18   because this statement says that what you have told

19   me is that nobody has prospectively identified a

20   subgroup of patients that have a higher likelihood of

21   benefitting from it, and then randomizing them to

22   look at some of these outcomes that HCFA was

23   interested in understanding the effect of.  And when

24   you do it across the whole board, you find

25   wishy-washy results.  I mean, that's sort of what I

00131

1   heard you say, and everyone agreed to that.

2   And then in light of that, I find this

3   thing very disturbing, that the FDA says because this

4   is a basic -- where it -- it's unethical to subject

5   patients to the risk and discomforts of frank

6   carnitine deficiency in a study designed to assess

7   the clinical benefit of this supplementation because

8   it's an essential metabolic intermediate and that

9   regardless of cause can be a serious and life

10   threatening condition.  Now, is there evidence that,

11   and that's the part that I'm missing, is there

12   evidence that if this value or something gets low

13   enough that this is a life threatening condition?

14   DR. SOX:  John?

15   DR. WHYTE:  I missed part of your question

16   as I was trying to find the original questions, but

17   the comments that I wanted to make, Dr. Brook,

18   relating to issues of process from a staff level is

19   we provided the panel with a lot of information and

20   as Dr. Holohan pointed out, we broke it up by certain

21   types of indications.  And part of your issues

22   relating to process, that may be too many questions

23   for the panel to answer for each particular

24   indication.  Whatever the point is about that, what I

25   have to emphasize is that the panel did not vote on

00132

1   those questions and it probably should not be

2   presumed by this committee that by not voting on

3   those questions they voted no or said anything about

4   the adequacy of the evidence.

5   In terms of the information we provided to

6   the panel and what we were trying to sort out, the

7   issues are similar to what Dr. Garber mentioned a few

8   minutes ago about how levels correlate with symptoms

9   and what's the appropriate measure.  Just from a

10   staff level, part of the issue relating to levels is

11   what we want to consider.  If we operationalize a

12   policy, there are some issues of a level helps us to

13   have some indication of how symptoms improve.

14   But the important point that I wanted to

15   make, again, was that it shouldn't be assumed that

16   because they didn't vote on the questions, that they

17   felt that there was not adequate evidence to answer

18   those questions.

19   DR. SOX:  Daisy.

20   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  I still don't quite

21   understand how questions are presented to a panel,

22   and they fail to respond in any way.

23   DR. WHYTE:  I can tell you, Dr. Smith,

24   this isn't the first time, as Dr. Tunis pointed out,

25   that it's happened.  It's happened on other panels as

00133

1   well, and part of what we tried to do is to give the

2   panels flexibility based on the discussions that

3   happen at the panel meeting.  Just to tell you

4   process from a staff level internally, we think about

5   what the questions need to be, and we develop the

6   questions in consultation with the chair and the vice

7   chair of the panel, and then we present the

8   questions.  Sometimes during the discussion of the

9   meeting other points are brought up, and that's

10   partly what happened at this meeting, that the panel

11   decides to modify them.

12   And you bring up the point, maybe we

13   should force the panel to vote on the questions we

14   originally asked, but as Dr. Tunis has pointed out,

15   that has not always been optimal either.

16   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  Here is a second part

17   of the question.  Based upon the responses to the

18   questions that they chose to answer, did that prove

19   to be beneficial to you?

20   DR. WHYTE:  Since the panel meeting, we

21   have continued to do a lot of research on the topic.

22   And what I can tell you, it was beneficial because

23   what the panel has basically said is they want us to

24   define what is carnitine deficiency, and that is

25   something that we were working on prior to submitting

00134

1   these questions to the panel, so we are continuing to

2   work on carnitine deficiency, and what I would say is

3   that the panel has sensitized us to the importance of

4   that.  As Dr. Garber points out, there may be more

5   than one way to identify patients with carnitine

6   deficiency but not something that we're doing.

7   And then the other point we talk about is

8   the second point about there's adequate evidence that

9   some patients might benefit, because they viewed it

10   in the aggregate that some patients benefit, and that

11   we needed to more work based on the literature, or

12   perhaps presentation of data, to identify that

13   patient population, and that is something that we're

14   doing.

15   So I think these recommendations actually

16   are things that we have been working on since the

17   panel meeting after getting a sense of where the

18   panel thought we should be going.

19   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  Last question.

20   DR. WHYTE:  Sure.

21   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  Again, once we respond

22   to their recommendations, should they be able to

23   answer the original questions?

24   DR. WHYTE:  I think they will answer the

25   original questions.

00135

1   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  Thank you.

2   DR. SOX:  Randel?

3   MS. RICHNER:  In terms of process, I think

4   this discussion both from the PET discussions earlier

5   and now this, once again, it really highlights how we

6   have to work on process this afternoon, and I'm

7   hoping that we will have a chance to do that.  I have

8   actually asked Connie to make copies again of the

9   guidelines so we can go back to the issue which is

10   very fundamental to all of this, is what questions

11   need to be asked of the panel and how does that

12   process work and who has input into those questions

13   along the way, and how are these defined.

14   And then further, in terms of what are --

15   if Sean, the Executive Committee is sort of stuck in

16   this conundrum of having to do the ratification of

17   the panel discussions until we can fix BIPA and so

18   that we don't have to go through ratification

19   anymore, then Leslie and I talked at break, what is

20   our remit then in terms of ratifying their decisions?

21   Is it about looking again at the evidence or is it

22   about how the process went within the committee and

23   how they made their decisions?  Because we're going

24   to end up going into a spiral again on this carnitine

25   issue if we're looking at the evidence, or if we're

00136

1   looking at the process.  So Sean, we need your

2   guidance here.

3   DR. SOX:  Well once -- we're going to stop

4   having any sort of approval function after this

5   meeting, but we still have a function to oversee the

6   process the panels undertake and to be sure that they

7   follow process, that they report in a way that people

8   can understand the logic that links the evidence to

9   their conclusions, and generally to have an oversight

10   function that I hope that we are very active about,

11   because I think it's an very important role for this

12   group here.  And I agree with you, I think there are

13   some holes here, and that there is a job for us to

14   do.

15   This statement here which at least I

16   didn't see until today, doesn't give any kind of

17   flavor for the discussion of what the original

18   questions were, why they decided to abandon those

19   questions, which I think is their privilege.  We may

20   criticize that on the basis of their reasoning for

21   abandoning them, but we're left with a very skeleton

22   document that doesn't give any sense of either the

23   process or really the rationale for the final

24   recommendations, which we're learning during this

25   discussion but personally I think we ought to be

00137

1   seeing them before we get to the meeting.  John.

2   DR. FERGUSON:  As some of you know, I was

3   director of the consensus program the NIH for 11

4   years and the program has existed for 25 now.  And

5   the crucial thing besides the composition of the

6   panel was the formulation of the questions which the

7   panel was asked to address.  And the planning

8   committees always spent nearly a day, at least half a

9   day formulating those questions, and that was a

10   fairly high powered group.  And every panel,

11   virtually everyone wanted to change the questions or

12   at least some of the questions once they got to the

13   consensus conference, and we made it a standard rule

14   that the questions could not be changed.

15   Now, I would suggest that formulating the

16   questions for which these panels are going to be

17   asked to address is a very very important thing and

18   the wording is terribly important, and that possibly

19   some of our input, certainly the panel chair's input

20   could be, and getting a review of those questions

21   once CMS has formulated them.

22   DR. TUNIS:  I would just emphasize, HCFA

23   spends a tremendous amount of time working on these

24   questions.  But as you know, part of the reason we

25   refer a small percentage of issues to the coverage

00138

1   advisory committee is that we find the issues to be

2   complex enough that in fact we cannot guarantee that

3   the questions are perfectly formulated.  If we could,

4   we probably wouldn't need to come to MCAC with the

5   issue in the first place.

6   In the case of the PET for breast cancer,

7   I think the panel made a very intelligent refinement

8   of a question by breaking it into two pieces and that

9   was arrived at by a careful review and discussion of

10   the evidence that is the function of the MCAC in the

11   first place.  So I don't think there is ever going to

12   be a way that we can guarantee, no matter how careful

13   the process, that we will get the questions

14   perfectly.

15   And I don't agree that we should never

16   consider changing the questions once we get there,

17   because again, it assumes that we knew more going

18   into the meeting that than we have learned during the

19   meeting.  And this isn't the NIH consensus process,

20   this is a coverage advisory committee, it's a

21   different process, it has a different function.  So

22   you know, I think that part of what is going on here

23   is part of the process that needs to go on, which is

24   you know, dealing with difficult issues and a

25   difficult process.

00139

1   So you know, whether or not this is the

2   way it should have worked and that we should have

3   changed these questions, is obviously open to

4   discussion.

5   What I also do want to point out is in

6   terms of the function of the Executive Committee

7   related to the panels, it was a legal requirement

8   that we have an executive committee reporting to CMS,

9   so the purely technical reason behind it was that

10   panels would report to the Executive Committee out of

11   necessity, not because anybody thought that was the

12   perfect process.  Since we have the ratification

13   function we have to figure out what to do with it,

14   and I think you need to understand that we take the

15   input and discussion of the panels and even if the

16   Executive Committee completely came to a different

17   conclusion doesn't mean that we don't pay attention

18   to what the panel said.  We take into account what

19   the Executive Committee says in addition to what the

20   panel says.

21   So it's all, you know, recommendatory or

22   whatever the word is, advisory, that's a better word,

23   thank you.  And so I just don't think you have to

24   worry quite so much about, you know, whether this is

25   an undermining of the panels.  It's all additive to

00140

1   the input that we get from the panels.

2   DR. SOX:  Yeah, but transparency is

3   important in public affairs and when you get a

4   document that is so opaque as this one, we're not,

5   it's our job to be sure that panels are accountable

6   to us and the public, and part of that is explaining

7   their reasoning if they go off in a different

8   direction.

9   MS. RICHNER:  There is just one thing I

10   want to add.  The problem is that if we should send

11   the decision back to the panel once again, we have a

12   time issue, and that could prolong this process

13   exponentially.  I'm sure Barbara was a little

14   concerned that this was going to go back to panel, as

15   we all were, so we have to take that into account as

16   well, Sean.  I agree, and I respect that you're

17   taking all of this in as an advisory kind of issue,

18   but process could lead to a very very long time

19   associated with this, so we have to be very cognizant

20   of what we recommend and advise, and how we ratify

21   this.

22   DR. SOX:  I just want to remind us that

23   while we're getting off into important general

24   discussion of process, that we aren't going to go to

25   lunch until we deal with these recommendations, so I

00141

1   do want to move us back fairly quickly to

2   recommendation number 2 and whether it's phrased, you

3   know, whether we should have it stand as it is.  But

4   why don't we take a couple more questions on the

5   general issue.

6   DR. BROOK:  Hal, let me just make two

7   comments.  The first is that what Barbara's group did

8   was to split a question and then vote on both parts

9   of it, and that's fine, and we know how to make that

10   in the record transparent.  I can't tell from

11   number 2 whether what Tom's group did was to take the

12   individual indicators of respiratory, exercise

13   tolerance, EPO requirements and others, and lump them

14   together in this vague group called patients benefit

15   because they couldn't answer the individual questions

16   and try to lump them together.  I am assuming that's

17   what they did here, because it would be nice if that

18   was transparent.

19   Now, what's missing from this is the

20   statement of how they judged adequate evidence, and I

21   think we have to vote no, given our process on

22   anything that says there is adequate evidence without

23   the question that Barbara's panel was forced to vote

24   on, which was, what's the effect, how did they get to

25   that level, what's the evidence based upon, some

00142

1   statement in the minutes to make it transparent.  We

2   seem to approve without discussion anything that says

3   there is insufficient evidence or inadequate, we

4   don't spend a lot of time on those things.

5   So I'm wondering whether, Tom, there is

6   stuff in the minutes, or the transcripts, that you

7   can add something to this that would say we based

8   adequacy on the following, so that there is something

9   here that would explain how you judged adequacy of

10   evidence against the process that we put together.

11   Can we add two or three sentences here?

12   DR. HOLOHAN:  It's possible, but I can't

13   guarantee that that would be satisfactory.

14   DR. SOX:  Maybe I can say it a little bit

15   differently than Bob.  Adequate ought to mean more or

16   less the same thing regardless of which panel is

17   reporting on which issue, and if we allow adequate to

18   take on whatever meaning the panel chooses to impose

19   on it in the course of a discussion, you know, we

20   don't have a good process.  And you can say adequate

21   and then give qualifiers that indicate it really

22   isn't quite up to the usual standard, but we're going

23   to have to learn how to be consistent from panel to

24   panel and discussion to discussion in how we use

25   really important words like adequate evidence.

00143

1   DR. HOLOHAN:  The transcript does reflect

2   my reading the summary of the definition of adequate

3   evidence based on the material the Executive

4   Committee provided.  I'm not sure you can follow that

5   trail clearly through to these conclusions.

6   DR. SOX:  Let's talk about this.  Do we

7   simply want to leave this stand?  Maybe I can just

8   raise a question, Tom.  Was the implication that the

9   evidence was good enough so that HCFA should go ahead

10   and provide coverage as soon as the guidelines are

11   created without any sort of further consideration of

12   for example, your ability to identify which

13   population would benefit?

14   DR. HOLOHAN:  Well, I thought that was

15   part and parcel of number 2, that establishment of

16   rational guidelines that identified this patient

17   population, i.e., those patients who would benefit,

18   Medicare coverage should be provided.

19   DR. SOX:  And that's sort of based on

20   things like 8 out of 17 and 9 out of 18 patients

21   benefitted.  Yes?

22   MR. MEHRLING:  In going through the

23   minutes, and I appreciate the difficulty in

24   identifying this, but Dr. Paganini actually tried to

25   address that specific issue, and he started, you

00144

1   know, I think you stated correctly what I wanted to

2   do.  I'm very concerned that if we take all the data

3   that has been presented and has been shown and has

4   been published, that there are some very significant

5   responders in that population that carry the mean of

6   those studies.  And if we say that there is no

7   indication that carnitine does any good to anybody

8   based on those studies which are very weak, we are

9   going to eliminate a significant number, albeit not a

10   large proportion, but still a significant number of

11   folks that do respond to this therapy and have had

12   dramatic responses, not only -- and it goes on.

13   What he was really doing was showing that

14   there were some studies where the mean was carried by

15   a small number, and they wanted to get at identifying

16   better who those patients were, although the studies

17   were statistically significant, and that was part of

18   the discussion.

19   DR. BROOK:  Can I -- what I don't

20   understand is if you take a group of hypertensive

21   patients and you treat them, not all of them are

22   going to benefit from hypertension therapy but the

23   studies would show that some do, and we then approve

24   it for everybody because we don't know up front which

25   of these will benefit, because we can't tell which

00145

1   person with the 95 diastolic will benefit from this

2   drug, and we would probably have to give 100 people

3   the drug to have one person benefit.

4   Now what I'm asking, from the data that

5   you reviewed, the panel process, when you reviewed

6   these studies, did you believe that there was a

7   statistical case made using our definition of

8   evidence, that when they gave this group of patients

9   this drug that any of these, I don't care, any, all,

10   collectively, singularly, that any of these benefits

11   actually were different, indicating that there is

12   some action in at least some subset of this

13   population by providing this supplement?

14   I mean, the way you presented it, Tom, I

15   got the sense that you didn't believe that, and

16   that's what really shook me up.

17   DR. HOLOHAN:  Well, you've asked two

18   things.  You said when you looked at all of these

19   data for all of these indications, did you believe it

20   was beneficial and the answer was no, the panel

21   generally concluded that the evidence was

22   insufficient for treatment or prevention of any of

23   those signs or symptoms.  But then you went on to say

24   but did you believe there was a subset, and I think

25   several members of the panel believed there was, as I

00146

1   quoted Dr. Paganini's statement.

2   DR. BROOK:  That was shown by the data,

3   not that was shown by, I treated three people and

4   they benefitted and the symptoms disappeared.  I

5   understand that.  I don't understand -- I mean, do

6   you believe that there was a subset, or is the subset

7   so small, like one in a thousand, that the sample

8   size just overwhelms it with noise and the studies

9   have not been able to pick it up?

10   I don't understand what the panel believed

11   about the evidence.  Once you tell me that, then we

12   can understand when you meant here.

13   DR. HOLOHAN:  I think that was

14   encapsulated in -- do you want to read Dr. Paganini's

15   statement again?  I think that was generally accepted

16   by most of the panel members.

17   DR. BROOK:  So let me go through this,

18   that the proportion of people is so small that the

19   evidence for the studies as a whole, all of the

20   studies doesn't support it.

21   DR. HOLOHAN:  Are not compelling.

22   DR. BROOK:  And the reason it doesn't

23   support this is there are so many people in this

24   group that don't benefit from the supplementation,

25   and therefore the noise of just having those people

00147

1   there overshadows this small effect that clinicians

2   have observed in a few very seriously deficient

3   patients who get better with this therapy, and that

4   that's the belief, that was how the evidence was put

5   together by the panel.

6   MR. MEHRLING:  Dr. Paganini was not

7   stating that, and I don't mean to correct but to

8   clarify, that the mean is carried by the responders,

9   and that you would have a 7 of 15, or a 4 of 15

10   respond, and the change would be statistically

11   significant as a group.

12   (Inaudible colloquy, people speaking at

13   same time.)

14   DR. GARBER:  He's just saying that the

15   benefits are skewed and so the problem with that of

16   course, is that when you say the benefits are skewed,

17   that's kind of like saying that people who do well

18   with surgery are going to do well with surgery.

19   You're defining by the end point rather than, unless

20   you can prospectively identify that skewed group,

21   because the benefit is not really useful.

22   DR. BROOK:  If the drug is completely

23   safe, Alan, I beg to differ.  If this is a really

24   safe drug and you don't have to identify who's

25   benefitting if in the whole population basically the

00148

1   mean level of the population is different.  Just like

2   you treat everyone with diastolics of 95 even though

3   we don't know who benefits from them or not.

4   (Inaudible colloquy, people speaking at

5   same time.)

6   DR. GARBER:  But whether it's skewed or

7   not, if you thought that this was a net beneficial on

8   an average group of population, then you would say

9   yes, it's a good thing.  You can only take advantage

10   of the skewness if you can prospectively identify the

11   subgroup.

12   DR. BROOK:  Absolutely.  Like HCFA has

13   done with oxygen lower than 55, or whatever the value

14   is, we give them home oxygen, or if you get epogen,

15   if the value is below something on a hematocrit or

16   anemia, because we believe that those people

17   benefitted more.  All I'm saying here is that you

18   don't, I mean, did you find statistical evidence, and

19   I'm pushing it.  What I don't here from you is that

20   the statistical case was actually made that any of

21   these studies prospectively identified a subgroup and

22   that in that subgroup it benefitted.  On the other

23   hand, the stuff that Alan quoted suggested that there

24   was responders in terms of epogen.  Is that correct?

25   And if that's correct, then we have a benefit and we

00149

1   have a study, and we have evidence, and if we accept

2   that as a benefit, then we can accept recommendation

3   number 2.

4   DR. SOX:  If the evidence that epogen

5   requirements are reduced is a statistically

6   significant observation in a recently constituted

7   patient sample then we can probably accept the truth

8   of number 2.  We don't have to identify who they are.

9   DR. GARBER:  Well, they have to correspond

10   to populations in those studies.

11   DR. SOX:  Right.  But at least I haven't

12   heard the level of evidence and the level of detail

13   in this doesn't really tell me in small numbers

14   whether this was a real, or consistent with a chance

15   fluctuation.

16   Would you like to identify yourself?

17   DR. SCHREIBER:  I'm Dr. Brian Schreiber.

18   I'm an assistant clinical professor of nephrology at

19   Medical College of Wisconsin.  I also am a clinical

20   nephrologist in charge of 300 dialysis patients in

21   Wisconsin, and I also consult for Sigma Tau because I

22   studied carnitine for many years, have published on

23   it and researched carnitine.

24   I apologize for not speaking sooner.  I

25   don't really know the process here, but I do want to

00150

1   just -- I was at the meeting, I do want to help

2   clarify some questions that have been raised.

3   DR. SOX:  I do want you to focus on

4   question number 2.

5   DR. SCHREIBER:  Absolutely.  First of all,

6   the actual -- you know, this question, was there

7   evidence, was there not evidence, the actual motion

8   that was actually passed, was voted on and passed

9   actually contained the words that there was adequate

10   evidence, adequate evidence that certain subgroups of

11   ESRD patients on dialysis would benefit from

12   administration of levo-carnitine.  Now, exactly what

13   Dr. Garber said is what was found.

14   See, the hearings, the panel actually did

15   a very detailed look at each of these studies.  The P

16   values were significant in many of these studies.  A

17   pattern emerged however, where in many of these

18   studies there were dramatic responders and it was the

19   feeling of many people that these dramatic responders

20   were accounting for the positive P values.  Yes, they

21   were positive P values, they were statistically

22   significant.  And we, what happened was I got the

23   sense frankly, this was a very good panel and

24   Dr. Holohan ran this like the best med school

25   professor I have ever seen.  He had people looking

00151

1   deeper than the questions were asked.

2   And what happened was people said okay,

3   yes, it's statistically significant, the P values are

4   good, but they also are skewed as a very dramatic

5   group.  So shouldn't we say that we should try to

6   identify this group, that to get this it would be

7   better if we could prospectively identify this group,

8   and that's what the conclusion was.  It was not

9   saying that the P values were not significant, it was

10   acknowledging there was a clustering of dramatic

11   responders.  Let's tell HCFA to go to work and find

12   out how to maximize the chance of getting that

13   cluster, and that's what the recommendation was in

14   regards to 2.

15   Can I say one thing about levels please?

16   As far as the levels in the FDA, there is some

17   confusion there because the FDA's statement on

18   levels, and this is why the people were a little

19   unclear on levels, refers to primary carnitine

20   deficiency, a condition in children principally who

21   are unable to metabolize carnitine.  These were not

22   dialysis patients, so the level of 20 percent.  They

23   found, the reason the FDA actually approved carnitine

24   is that they found that the mean level between

25   dialyses approximated that, and so people said well,

00152

1   should we just talk about a level?

2   What Dr. Kopple, who is one of the eminent

3   people in nephrology and metabolism within nephrology

4   pointed out, and many nephrologists believe, that you

5   have to look at carnitine deficiency and carnitine

6   insufficiency, meaning you have to balance the

7   carnitine according to how many fatty acids you have

8   to metabolize.

9   And that's what was raised to the

10   committee, that you can't necessarily take a level

11   that has been examined in primary carnitine

12   deficiency in children with healthy kidneys, and

13   generalize that to the dialysis population.  And they

14   felt, again, that we had to look deeper at that,

15   because the metabolic needs of the dialysis patients

16   were different.  So that's why it was sent back to

17   HCFA, to say okay, you get together some smart people

18   in nephrology and you tell us in dialysis patients

19   how you would define that, because the population the

20   FDA was talking about in terms of its level statement

21   was different.  Does that make it any clearer?

22   DR. SOX:  Thank you.

23   DR. GARBER:  I'm just wondering, John

24   Whyte told us that they really didn't do an extensive

25   look at the literature on levels of carnitine and so

00153

1   on.  Is there a literature that we could turn to that

2   hasn't been reviewed by MCAC or by the panel that

3   would help you to identify that subgroup of high

4   responders if you want to call it that, that really

5   respond well to carnitine supplementation?  Is there

6   a literature, or would this be just the opinions of

7   experienced clinicians not directly supported by

8   formal studies.

9   DR. SCHREIBER:  That's a good question.

10   There is not a dedicated literature to that.

11   However, what we did and what took place actually at

12   Dr. Holohan's direction was looking at the studies

13   and looking at the characteristics of studies that

14   had more positive outcomes and more negative

15   outcomes.  And what the panel did was then look at

16   the characteristics of the patients, whether the

17   condition existed and was clearly defined, whether

18   alternative explanations for the same clinical

19   condition had been looked at, and we compared those

20   things.  And so it was really taking from the

21   studies, trying to extrapolate that group.

22   But as far as studies where they started

23   out prospectively with that group, that is within

24   those studies, a lot of that information is within

25   those studies, and that's where the meeting was

00154

1   directed, to try to extrapolate that, and that's

2   where CMS has also been directing its attention, to

3   try to extrapolate, because there's a lot of data on

4   carnitine, it has been around a long time, and so to

5   extrapolate from the data that's there the best ways

6   to define this group.  Within the data that's there,

7   you can make those extrapolations, but it's contained

8   within the greater literature.

9   DR. SOX:  I'm hoping that a story is

10   emerging that is making us more comfortable with

11   number 2, I'm not sure that is true, but I think we

12   do need to move on, so if we could have a few wrap-up

13   comments on number 2, I don't think we're going to

14   learn much more to help us on this.  Bob, and then

15   Bob.

16   DR. BROOK:  If I could just ask one

17   question about number 2.  Did the panel decide, the

18   first part is adequate evidence that some patients

19   would benefit.  What I'm asking is did the panel

20   discuss when they did this asking the question that

21   because of the uncertainty of this protocol of

22   identifying patients that Medicare, that CMS should

23   actually set up number 1 and test it, as opposed to a

24   demand that everyone gets full coverage to it?  Was

25   there some discussion of that?

00155

1   I'm just trying to get the intent of the

2   panel out of this, because you go from this to that

3   once we have this, everyone ought to be covered.  Do

4   you think it's unethical, or did the panel discuss

5   this, that it would be reasonable once you develop

6   this protocol to randomize people?  These look like

7   very short-term outcomes in terms of EPO, hematocrits

8   and hemoglobins, you know, is this something that

9   everybody ought to be covered that you felt at the

10   moment, or how did the panel get from the first

11   sentence to the second sentence, that Medicare

12   coverage should be provided to everybody?

13   DR. HOLOHAN:  Let me think about that

14   nonsuccinct question.  The panel never reached to the

15   issue of whether research should be done, either

16   sponsored by HCFA or not, to identify that group of

17   patients.  What the panel believed was that until and

18   unless there were reasonably sufficient information

19   that could a priori identify patients who would be

20   likely to benefit, that Medicare should not routinely

21   provide this as a benefit to all patients, some of

22   whom might potentially benefit.

23   DR. BROOK:  I understand that, but how

24   about the ones, let's say tomorrow they come up with

25   this mechanism, define this mechanism.  I just want

00156

1   to make sure, the intent of the panel was that once

2   CMS does that, that the advice to CMS would be to

3   recommend coverage for everyone that falls into that

4   guideline.

5   DR. HOLOHAN:  Correct.

6   DR. BROOK:  Without any further testing.

7   You didn't think there was a need for any further

8   scientific data, based on --

9   DR. HOLOHAN:  Now, the premise as I

10   understand it that you have proposed is if in fact

11   one could reliably identify those patients who would

12   benefit, and the panel believed that it was possible

13   to do that, that for those patients coverage should

14   be provided.  I would think intrinsic in that is the

15   belief that the mechanism for identifying them would

16   be less than accurate, so why would you have to study

17   something?

18   DR. BROOK:  So you believe that there is

19   such a mechanism that can be done, the data supports

20   all that and that's the logic behind this

21   recommendation.  I just want to be clear about that,

22   the panel in reviewing the evidence believes that CMS

23   can do this, and once it's done, it would be

24   unethical really to randomize these patients or to

25   study it any further, it's time to cover them.

00157

1   DR. HOLOHAN:  I don't think the panel

2   overtly or covertly expressed the level of confidence

3   in CMS's probability of success in establishing these

4   guidelines but the panel thought that it was a worthy

5   attempt.

6   DR. BROOK:  So, I move we ratify all three

7   motions.

8   DR. AUBRY:  Second.

9   DR. FRANCIS:  I need to understand 3.

10   DR. SOX:  Okay.  We're on to 3 unless

11   there is something big on number 2.  Wade.

12   DR. AUBRY:  This is a point of

13   clarification.  Was it the intent of the panel when

14   you talked about rational guidelines that identify

15   the patient population, you also were including in

16   that rational guidelines for therapeutic dose?

17   DR. HOLOHAN:  No, we did not address the

18   dose.  If you look at the little matrix that I handed

19   out and just looked at the dosage, routes of

20   administration and dosages, it was impossible.  They

21   were all over the chart.

22   DR. AUBRY:  Well, I'm not sure this needs

23   to be in a motion, but I would hope that CMS when it

24   does its review would also try to develop some

25   rational guidelines for dosage as well, but I'm not

00158

1   making a motion.

2   DR. SOX:  Let's go on to number 3, Leslie.

3   DR. FRANCIS:  Yeah.  I just heard two

4   different things and I want clarification.  Does 3

5   say the evidence is sufficient that the route of

6   administration doesn't matter, or does 3 say the

7   evidence is insufficient that it does, and I thought

8   I heard you say both of these.

9   DR. HOLOHAN:  Well, what this says is what

10   it says.

11   DR. FRANCIS:  So it's insufficient

12   evidence about whether the route matters?

13   DR. HOLOHAN:  Yes.

14   DR. FRANCIS:  So we would want to get more

15   evidence about whether it does.

16   Dr. HOLOHAN:  But we didn't answer that

17   question.

18   DR. SOX:  Any other questions about

19   number 3?  In that case I think it's time for a

20   motion and a vote.

21   MS. ANDERSON:  We actually have a motion

22   on the floor, Dr. Brook's motion that we vote on all

23   three, and Dr. Aubry has seconded it.

24   DR. SOX:  Okay.  Any discussion of

25   Dr. Brook's motion to approve all three of these?  In

00159

1   that case, aren't you supposed to do this?

2   MS. ANDERSON:  This is my part.  For the

3   record, Dr. Garber is absent for this vote.

4   And the motion is to approve all three

5   recommendations of the Drugs Biologics and

6   Therapeutics Panel.  And those who are voting for?

7   Those who are voting against?  And those who are

8   abstaining?  It's unanimous, with the one absence.

9   DR. SOX:  I note that we're only five

10   minutes, and we will resume please, promptly at 1:30,

11   because we have a very interesting discussion this

12   afternoon.

13   (Luncheon recess from 12:37 to 1:38 p.m.)

14   DR. SOX:  I would like to begin the

15   afternoon session.  We are going to spend the next

16   hour or so reflecting on our guidelines for

17   evaluating diagnostic tests, specifically imaging

18   tests, and Sean is going to lead this off.  Ellen

19   Feigal, from National Cancer Institute, is going to

20   follow.  Alan and I will make some brief unprepared

21   comments, and then we will have a general discussion,

22   the goal being to think about our guidelines for

23   evaluating diagnostic tests and decide whether the

24   results of this workshop might lead to us want to

25   make some changes.  So with that, I will turn it over

00160

1   to Sean.

2   DR. TUNIS:  All right.  Well, we decided

3   to, you know, add this session to discuss the

4   framework for evaluating diagnostic tests, and that

5   hopefully, you know, people can be somewhat more

6   interactive and controversial than they were this

7   morning.  Especially Dr. Brook, I think you really

8   need to come to the fore to a greater extent.

9   (Laughter.)

10   DR. BROOK:  You realize this is in a

11   formal set of minutes?

12   DR. TUNIS:  Yes.

13   DR. BROOK:  Can I get severance pay for

14   life from this committee?

15   DR. TUNIS:  We will but put that through

16   our process and let you know.

17   So anyway, I just wanted to give a couple

18   minutes introduction to how we came to collaborate

19   with the NCI and particularly Dr. Feigal on having

20   had a workshop to address the issue of alternative

21   frameworks for evaluating diagnostic tests.  As many

22   of you know, the existing framework that the MCAC has

23   developed and is attempting to apply to making

24   recommendations on diagnostic tests fundamentally

25   works by looking at specific indications for use of

00161

1   the diagnostic tests one at a time.

2   So for example, we would be looking at in

3   the imaging area, we're looking at the use of PET

4   scanning for breast cancer, for the staging of the

5   axillary lymph nodes, and we're looking at evidence

6   for that specific indication and trying to make some

7   conclusion based on the literature that directly

8   addressed that question.  What has been pointed out

9   as a limitation of that approach, particularly

10   relating to imaging and oncology, is that it could

11   potentially require a vast amount of clinical

12   research because the number of potential clinical

13   applications within any individual cancer are quite

14   numerous, and you know, there's sort of the four

15   basic categories of screening diagnosis, staging,

16   restaging, and monitoring response to therapy, but

17   within that there are all kinds of individual

18   clinical applications that might even be refinements

19   within those.  So restaging colorectal cancer within

20   the setting of a rising CEA, for example, is a

21   specific question that one might look at separately

22   and require a separate body of clinical research for.

23   So one of the things that we were looking

24   to explore was whether there were approaches to

25   evaluation of diagnostic tests that would allow some

00162

1   sort of sensible extrapolation from clinical evidence

2   in one particular clinical use to other clinical uses

3   for which there is not direct scientific evidence.

4   And the idea would be for example, that if you knew

5   something about the metabolic activity related to FDG

6   of breast cancer, that might be informative if you

7   knew then that FDG-PET was useful for restaging of

8   breast cancer, might you also be able to make some

9   logical conclusions about its clinical utility in

10   monitoring responses to therapy.  Those are just some

11   examples that we're currently faced with.

12   As I mentioned kind of at the end of our

13   breast cancer discussion this morning, we did for the

14   December decision memo on PET scanning for six

15   oncologic indications, we kind of did a quick and

16   dirty version of this extrapolating already, which is

17   we essentially made up a rule that said if you have

18   clinical, good scientific proof of clinical

19   effectiveness for a single indication within a

20   cancer, Medicare will provide coverage for all

21   clinical indications within that cancer except for

22   those where there is not, where there is some

23   evidence to suggest that it wouldn't be useful for

24   that clinical application.

25   And kind of the crude notion there was

00163

1   that within a cancer there is some commonality of the

2   biology or molecular activity related to PET and one

3   might be able to make extrapolations that the

4   clinical utility proven in one clinical application

5   would be extrapolatable to others.  It's by no means,

6   that doesn't integrate seamlessly with the evidence

7   based approach for coverage decision making or the

8   MCAC recommendations that have been enunciated in the

9   MCAC guidelines.  And so to sort of further explore

10   those issues we had this workshop and Ellen Feigal is

11   going to talk a little bit about some of what came

12   out of that workshop and then I throw the whole issue

13   open to discussion for the committee.  So with that,

14   Ellen, I'm sure so far everyone is with us and

15   they're completely on board.

16   DR. FEIGAL:  And they are all awake after

17   lunch.  What I'll do then is, Sean placed things in

18   context for you about the fact that our different

19   agencies are working together and in addition also

20   working with the Food and Drug Administration as

21   well, and what we were trying to do is brainstorm on

22   ways to think through this process, realizing that

23   the standard of conventional frameworks seems to be

24   based on sound scientific and clinical principles,

25   but to not go in the wrong direction but to balance

00164

1   this with the practical realities of conducting

2   clinical studies in people and all the vagaries of

3   how clinical studies need to be conducted, the

4   particular unique problems associated with doing

5   diagnostic studies, how it's a very complex route

6   between a diagnostic study and the actual management

7   that is decided on for that patient, and the fact

8   that you have different doctors delivering the

9   diagnostic test from the doctors who are actually

10   personally taking care of the patient.  So there are

11   lots of complex issues to take into account as we're

12   thinking about how to move forward and make some

13   forward progress in this area.

14   So what I'll do is just give you some

15   highlights from our workshop and then really the vast

16   majority of the time for discussion.  And I know this

17   goes without saying, but feel free to interrupt if

18   you have any questions.

19   We're just using this as a template to

20   focus the overhead.

21   Let's go to why did we even do this.  As

22   Sean went over, there were multiple reasons that we

23   thought were important to go over.  We thought that

24   the current MCAC diagnostic guidelines as they're

25   written requires accurate direct or empirical

00165

1   evidence for each clinical indication.  The fact of

2   the matter is there are many cancers and within each

3   cancer there's many diagnostic clinical settings.

4   And just to get down to the practical reality, it

5   probably is not practical or efficient to conduct

6   high quality evaluations for every proposed use of a

7   diagnostic technology.

8   MS. RICHNER:  Will we get copies of these?

9   DR. FEIGAL:  I will send them to Janet and

10   she could forward them.

11   DR. BROOK:  Did you note that I wasn't the

12   first to interrupt?  I want to note that formally for

13   the record.

14   (Laughter.)

15   MS. RICHNER:  It's always a race between

16   you and I.

17   DR. BROOK:  But the thing is, which is the

18   most disruptive interruption.

19   DR. FEIGAL:  So the overall, the purpose

20   of this workshop was really to get together an

21   interagency group.  We wanted to get together the

22   people who actually fund these type of scientific and

23   clinical studies, with the agencies that regulate the

24   approval of the products, with CMS who regulates the

25   coverage and reimbursement for the uses of these

00166

1   products.  We also wanted to get together with health

2   care providers, with investigators who see patients,

3   with technology developers, and see if we can at

4   least discuss ways to think about alternative

5   frameworks for scientifically based reproducible and

6   understanding decision making process.

7   And the reason why this was really

8   catalyzed by conversations that we've had with CMS,

9   in that they felt that they wanted to address this in

10   a more comprehensive way and to consider alternate

11   ways of thinking about this issue.  So we wanted to

12   explore alternative guidelines or frameworks for

13   evaluating diagnostic imaging that are explicit, that

14   are practical and that are efficient, and that these

15   guidelines or frameworks would consider several

16   fundamental characteristics of diagnostic imaging.

17   It may be that one size does not fit all,

18   maybe this doesn't apply across the whole menu of

19   diagnostic tests, but we thought there were some

20   specific issues in diagnostic imaging that warranted

21   further discussion and might be illustrative of other

22   issues that you address in other areas, so this is to

23   be thought of as an example.

24   DR. FERGUSON:  Am I to assume this is all

25   imaging diagnostic, not just cancer?

00167

1   DR. FEIGAL:  Well, I'm focused because I'm

2   from the National Cancer Institute, I'm focusing on

3   cancer.  Presumably this could be illustrative of

4   other types of diseases in which there are many

5   different indications within a specific disease, but

6   I'm just going to focus on the cancer issue.

7   Diagnostic imaging of course, these

8   technologies have potential value for many different

9   pathological conditions, many different diseases, and

10   these technologies have many different specific

11   clinical indications within each condition and for

12   each possible indication, there are numerous other

13   imaging or diagnostic study results for which the new

14   modality may substitute or it may provide

15   complementary information.  I'm not telling you

16   anything that's unique to cancer, but because I'm

17   from the Cancer Institute I'm just going to limit my

18   comments to the cancer issues.

19   We had the workshop, as I said, with

20   people from different agencies, with people who are

21   involved with doing technology assessment, with

22   clinicians who actually have to see patients and make

23   decisions when they're in their office, with

24   diagnostic radiologists who need to conduct these

25   tests and interpret the results, so we had a diverse

00168

1   group in the room of about 30 to go over these

2   issues, so we had people who had some sense of the

3   issues we were trying to address, but also had some

4   real experience, in the trenches experience of having

5   to deal with patient related issues and trying to put

6   this in the context of having some reasonable

7   guidelines to work under.

8   MS. RICHNER:  Did you have manufacturers

9   at all?

10   DR. FEIGAL:  We did not have anybody from

11   industry at this first meeting.  We thought of this

12   sort of as a process; we wanted to get sort of our

13   own ducks in a row to see if we could come to some

14   points of agreement at least among ourselves,

15   realizing that that may just be the first of several

16   steps that may subsequently need to take place.

17   DR. MCNEIL:  I don't understand the first

18   bullet.  Is that something you agreed was a

19   reasonable thing to do, or is that the reason we're

20   here, to discuss it further?

21   DR. FEIGAL:  This is the first time that

22   I'm bringing this out to the group, and so why don't

23   I go through the different points that we appeared to

24   agree upon at the meeting.  And Hal was at the

25   meeting, Al Garber was at the meeting, Sean was at

00169

1   the meeting.  I don't believe there's anybody else in

2   this room who was at the meeting, but they can also

3   offer their own interpretation as to our points of

4   agreement, but this was part of a summary that we put

5   together collaboratively and distributed to all

6   participants at the meeting, and as far as I can tell

7   there were no caveats to the summary.  These are the

8   consensus statements that are in the actual summary.

9   So I'm going over these now for the first time in a

10   more public setting.

11   DR. TUNIS:  But just to clarify on that

12   point, Barbara, this is really being presented as

13   kind of raw material for you all to consider, and if

14   the MCAC decides they really, after hearing this,

15   don't want to move anywhere beyond where our current

16   guidelines are, the current MCAC framework, that's

17   fine.  This is not activity meant to supersede the

18   authority of the MCAC to have their own guidelines

19   and framework.

20   DR. MCNEIL:  The reason I was asking,

21   Sean, is that's sort of a loaded statement in my view

22   and --

23   DR. FEIGAL:  Well, why don't you let me

24   before we interpret it, why don't you let me present

25   it with some additional words besides the bullets,

00170

1   because sometimes just reading the bullets, you might

2   come to one conclusion and so just like this morning

3   when you were going through things, why don't you let

4   me sort of present it and then we can discuss it.  Is

5   that all right?

6   DR. MCNEIL:  Sure, absolutely.

7   DR. FEIGAL:  So what we agreed on is at

8   least to consider developing a formal approach to use

9   modeling techniques as an adjunct or as a substitute

10   for clinical studies evaluation diagnostic tests.

11   What we're saying is consider whether or not modeling

12   might be one approach we could use to try and tackle

13   some of the complex issues that we have to deal with,

14   that there is a lot of evidence in one indication but

15   a very limited amount in another clinical setting of

16   that same cancer.  Or the issue that Sean was dealing

17   with, we may know quite a bit about breast cancer but

18   not very much about a rare form of sarcoma.  So it

19   was trying to get a sense of -- there was at least an

20   agreement that it was worth pursuing as an approach,

21   I'm not saying that we can do it.

22   DR. BROOK:  Why did you limit this to

23   diagnostic?  You have exactly the same problem on the

24   therapeutic side.

25   DR. FEIGAL:  Only because it's a huge

00171

1   issue and we're just trying to get our hands around

2   something that we could handle.  Also because we have

3   developed interagency collaboration in the area of

4   diagnostic imaging, so we were taking advantage of

5   the fact that we already have some working

6   relationships with the other agencies in diagnostic

7   imaging and so we thought it would be a good place to

8   start.

9   DR. BROOK:  So this is addressing the

10   balance between modeling and clinical studies to

11   provide evidence, is what this is about.

12   DR. FEIGAL:  This is just one half that

13   was discussed.

14   DR. BROOK:  I understand that, but th

15   overview of this is to address the issue between

16   producing evidence by clinical studies or by modeling

17   or combinations to advance knowledge, this is the

18   topic that you're talking about?

19   DR. FEIGAL:  For this one point.

20   DR. BROOK:  For diagnostics.

21   DR. FEIGAL:  No, for this one point of

22   points of agreement.

23   DR. BROOK:  It's diagnostics.

24   DR. FEIGAL:  Correct, in diagnostics.

25   There are other points that I'm going to get to on

00172

1   this transparency.

2   DR. BROOK:  Okay.  Can I just ask, what's

3   the motivation for doing this, where did this come

4   from?

5   DR. FEIGAL:  The motivation for doing this

6   is in the past, the way the diagnostic imaging has

7   come into play, x-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, is that

8   there has been sort of general coverage across a

9   whole variety of diseases, a whole variety of

10   conditions, and it's understood that there's

11   obviously many potential problems with having a broad

12   coverage in that regard because you may have use of

13   the technologies in inappropriate settings.  You may

14   certainly have use in appropriate settings, but you

15   also may have overutilization of the technology.

16   So that's one extreme.  Then what we're

17   going to now with the current guidelines is going

18   indication by indication by indication.

19   DR. BROOK:  I understand, but what you

20   said here is to use this as a coverage decision to

21   cover tests and procedures on a specific patient

22   indication by indication, that's what you said.

23   That's the major departure, not whether to use

24   modeling or clinical evidence, but to go beyond that

25   is that if you model this out, you would say only

00173

1   black men 60 to 69 would value from this diagnostic

2   test and nobody else would do this, or only people

3   that have this income or this characteristic of the

4   tumor or this characteristic of the particular

5   income.  The really major breakthrough here is not

6   whether you use modeling or clinical evidence, but

7   what you're really asking is can we move the coverage

8   decision down from we cover a therapy, you know,

9   anyone who has breast cancer, you're covered for a

10   mastectomy if you want, anyone that has breast cancer

11   can get covered for a PET scan if you want it, to a

12   very specific circumstance.  That's what you're

13   asking here, that's the question.

14   DR. TUNIS:  I just want to say, I think it

15   actually, if I understood it correctly, I think it's

16   slightly that the order is in the reverse, in that

17   coverage policy by Medicare for diagnostic technology

18   particularly, has historically been we cover CAT

19   scans and we don't make a lot of distinctions, they

20   are covered for such and such patients with these

21   characteristics.  With a more formal adoption of an

22   evidence based approach, as manifested in recent

23   decisions about PET, we have gotten more specific.

24   PET is covered for colorectal cancer in the setting

25   of a rising CEA, and the tension that this raised was

00174

1   this kind of historical balance of how Medicare used

2   to pay for things to how we have now gone through

3   paying for things on a very specific indication by

4   indication basis, and the additional demands that

5   places on clinical research that proves each

6   indication.

7   So now we're exploring alternatives about

8   are there intelligent defensible evidence based ways

9   of going beyond that.  Does that make sense?

10   DR. BROOK:  Yeah, but the only thing I

11   wanted to point out, there are certainly intelligible

12   ways to do this at a doctor-patient level.  That's

13   why I asked what the motivation was; this is not at

14   the doctor-patient level, this is at the coverage

15   level.

16   DR. FEIGAL:  That's right.

17   DR. BROOK:  And so what you're actually

18   trying to do is move along the agenda of how, instead

19   of having one criterion for covering CAT scans, you

20   might have 2,000 if you produce a modeling approach,

21   because you will, I know, because we have done this.

22   You might have 2,000 different scenarios of which the

23   modeling will support doing, covering for 33 percent

24   and 50 percent, and it would have to be updated, but

25   that's the road we're going down here.  I just wanted

00175

1   to make this explicit.

2   DR. FEIGAL:  And let me also make explicit

3   as well that I'm not advocating one route over

4   another, I'm not saying that this is the way I would

5   like this committee to consider that we go.  What I'm

6   saying is from the people who were at the meeting

7   when we were thinking about ways to intelligently

8   discuss what the challenges were and what the

9   problems were and what the vagaries are of doing

10   clinical research, how can we approach it in a

11   rational manner, in a balanced manner.  We know what

12   the ideal is.  We know what we would like every

13   investigator to do in terms of their studies, or

14   every sponsor to do in terms of their studies, and if

15   we had an unlimited supply of resources, personnel

16   and money, which nobody has, including CMS obviously,

17   there wouldn't be any challenge, we would do that.

18   What we're trying to do is balance the ideal with the

19   practical realities.

20   And so what we are trying to think of for

21   CMS is also a philosophical approach.  It's not a

22   right or wrong approach, is do we establish a ceiling

23   or do we establish a floor, you know.  So these are

24   the types of issues, there is no right or wrong, it's

25   just trying to think how can we move forward together

00176

1   in getting this done.

2   DR. MCNEIL:  The question I had, I think

3   may be a little bit of a follow-on to Bob's.  I think

4   the last two bullets are self explanatory and the

5   first one is the one on this slide that has the real

6   meat behind it.  And the issue there is, and maybe

7   you're going to talk about it in a subsequent slide,

8   but using modeling techniques as an adjunct or a

9   substitute, so the issue there to me following up on

10   what Bob said is are you using, are you proposing

11   that the group agree, because that's what it says,

12   points of agreement, to use modeling techniques to

13   come to the sensitivity and specificity of a

14   particular test for say the detection of disease, and

15   I don't know how you do that, or were they using it

16   to get the sensitivity and specificity of tests for a

17   particular purpose to see if they altered management,

18   or were they using modeling techniques to go the

19   whole nine yards into cost effectiveness and use

20   health outcomes, some kind of quality adjusted life

21   year for a diagnostic test?

22   I think that's quite -- well first of all,

23   I think it's probably impossible and would not be a

24   way we would want to go.

25   DR. FEIGAL:  As I said, I'm not an

00177

1   advocate of this, I don't even know if it's possible,

2   but there were many around the room that desired such

3   a model to consider whether or not such a model could

4   be developed.  We didn't get into a lot of the

5   details of the inputs, the outputs, the type of data

6   that would need to go in here and how we would

7   validate the model.  This was the beginning of a

8   conversation and so I can't give you a lot of

9   details, but certainly Hal, Alan or Sean --

10   DR. SOX:  I would suggest that Ellen plow

11   through her transparencies without interruption and

12   then we can come back and kind of go through it a

13   second time, but let's see the whole picture first.

14   DR. FEIGAL:  Let me go back to this

15   transparency.  We thought about three things from our

16   meeting; there were lots of good discussion, people

17   came from the technology assessment groups, from

18   health care providers, we heard from physicians at

19   research institutions in the field, we heard from

20   diagnostic radiologists, we heard from all the

21   agencies about the guidelines they use for approving

22   products, evidence gathered that we take into account

23   as we're trying to fund research or support research.

24   So all these different elements were discussed at

25   this meeting.

00178

1   There were basically three points of

2   agreement.  One was this model that we've just spent

3   a little bit of time discussing.  The second is, you

4   know, try to deal with things more down to earth,

5   that we have diagnostic guidelines currently in

6   place, to maybe consider some revisions to those

7   current guidelines might be considered.  And then

8   three, I think we all recognize the need to support

9   more high quality studies evaluating the clinical

10   utility of new diagnostic tests.  We all agreed that

11   those were three important points.

12   These are just possible next steps just to

13   stimulate discussion.  I realize I don't need to

14   stimulate discussion, but it was just to throw some

15   things on the table of possible next steps that could

16   take place.  If indeed it was thought worthwhile to

17   think about developing an analytical model, CMS would

18   take the lead in trying to work on the plans for

19   developing a model, for validating the model.  For

20   example, some felt that it might be possible to

21   develop models that incorporate existing information

22   on a technology's technical performance, the

23   incidence of various disease specific complications

24   outcomes, other known information, to produce

25   estimates of the likely clinical harms and benefits

00179

1   of an imaging procedure.

2   DR. BROOK:  Can I ask you, where are you

3   from, what agency.

4   DR. FEIGAL:  National Cancer Institute.

5   DR. BROOK:  What I'm really interested in,

6   why is this CMS's responsibility?  And I keep coming

7   back to everything you say makes a hell of a lot of

8   sense, the whole workshop makes sense, the

9   recommendations make sense.  What I really don't

10   understand is, as far as I know, there is no

11   strategic policy in the NIH to do any of this, and

12   you've got $14 billion or $15 billion worth of money,

13   and you have no strategic framework for how to

14   produce new clinical information about anything, as

15   far as I can tell.

16   The bottom line I would ask -- that's on

17   the record.  The bottom line that I would ask is why

18   should we turn this into a coverage decision and

19   expect this agency to do it and this panel to do it,

20   as opposed to turn this into a decision of how is the

21   agency going to use the clinical research money it

22   has to produce better information about when and how

23   diagnostics tests or therapy should be used in

24   people.  And what I'm really asking is, I'm confused

25   about why is this -- I mean, we could change our

00180

1   guidelines to do all this kind of stuff, that's easy.

2   But I'm really confused what's happening in the

3   government and the NIH level of a policy, or the

4   director of the NIH, why aren't you giving him, or

5   maybe you are, giving this briefing to him about

6   making this happen?

7   DR. FEIGAL:  Okay.  Let me take a step

8   back.  I have been asked to be the spokesperson for

9   this workshop.  I didn't propose that CMS do this,

10   CMS actually proposed that they do this, okay?

11   DR. BROOK:  With the $30,000 worth of

12   money it has for research?

13   DR. FEIGAL:  No.  Let's take a step back,

14   because what I'm trying to do is give you a --

15   DR. SOX:  Bob, no more rhetorical

16   questions for the next five minutes, please.

17   DR. FEIGAL:  I would be very happy to give

18   you --

19   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  I just want to say, I

20   am disturbed by this.  I think this is extremely

21   relevant, I find it quite beneficial, and the way

22   this young woman has been challenged and in my

23   opinion harassed in some ways --

24   DR. BROOK:  I apologize.

25   DR. ALFORD-SMITH:  -- while she is trying

00181

1   to provide information that is ultimately going to

2   help us in making decisions, and I would ask that we

3   at least respect that.

4   DR. SOX:  Go ahead, Ellen.

5   DR. FEIGAL:  Yeah.  I think that I would

6   be very happy to describe the NIH strategic plan and

7   the NCI strategic plan, but I don't think this body

8   is the appropriate forum to do that.  I am perfectly

9   capable of doing that but I don't think it's

10   appropriate.  I think that we do have things that

11   we're doing, we do have strategic areas for funding

12   scientific research and for funding clinical studies.

13   What we're trying to do is work with our partner

14   agencies on a common problem, how do we take emerging

15   technology that we think is important for patients

16   and move it into the clinic and get clinical studies

17   and then move it into the marketplace, where it can

18   be disseminated and actually make an impact on the

19   public health.

20   Because my sense of everybody in this room

21   is that what we're all interested in is improving the

22   public health.  What we're trying to do is come out

23   of our silos and try to work with our partners

24   because we think it will be beneficial to do things

25   together rather than to be doing things in our own

00182

1   back yard.  We think there is a benefit to doing

2   that, and
