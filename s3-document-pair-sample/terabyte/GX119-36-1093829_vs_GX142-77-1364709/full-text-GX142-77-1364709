The US Postal Service says typical characteristics include parcels that: are unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you. are addressed to someone no longer with your organization or are otherwise outdated. have no return address, or have one that can't be verified as legitimate. are of unusual weight, given their size, or are lopsided or oddly shaped. are marked with restrictive endorsements, such as "Personal" or "Confidential." have protruding wires, strange odors or stains. show a city or state in the postmark that doesn't match the return address. What do you do if you receive a suspicious parcel in the mail or if you receive an Anthrax threat by mail: Do not handle the mail piece or package suspected of contamination. Notify your supervisor, who will immediately contact the Inspection Service, local police, safety office or designated person. Make sure that damaged or suspicious packages are isolated and the immediate area cordoned off. . Ensure that all persons who have touched the mail piece wash their hands with soap and water. The Inspectors will collect the mail, assess the threat situation and coordinate with the FBI. Designated officials will notify local, county, and state health departments. Designated officials will notify the state emergency manager. List all persons who have touched the letter and/or envelope. Include contact information. Provide the list to the Inspection Service. Place all items worn when in contact with the suspected mail piece in plastic bags and keep them wherever you change your clothes and have them available for law enforcement agents. As soon as practical, shower with soap and water. If prescribed medication by medical personnel, take it until otherwise instructed or it runs out. Notify the Center for Disease Control Emergency Response at 770-488-7100 for answers to any questions. The following statement regarding the Anthrax bacteria is from Dr. David Johnson, Department of Community Health. "Anthrax exposure through the mail is extremely unlikely and symptoms of anthrax do not develop in a matter of hours. Even if someone has found a letter or package with a threatening note or large quantity of powdery substance, in the absence of illness there is no need to go directly to the hospital for anthrax treatment or testing," said Dr. David Johnson, Chief Medical Executive for the Michigan Department of Community Health. "If a person has a concern about a letter or package because of a threatening note or large quantity of powdery substance, local law enforcement would then contact the FBI. Together they would then assess the situation to determine if there is a credible threat and how to best proceed." The September 11 attacks and subsequent events have created an intense focus on emergency preparedness and on the preventive measures being implemented to protect our citizens. While the risk in Michigan is very small, every citizen has a duty to be vigilant, to have a heightened sense of awareness and to be prepared. The information in this document will help people all across Michigan understand what government is doing to respond as well as what they can do to safeguard their families. What is Michigan doing about the threat of terrorism? Terrorism is being addressed on many fronts in Michigan at federal, state and local levels. The Michigan State Police (MSP) is spearheading state government's response. The Michigan State Police investigates suspected or potential criminal enterprises and activities - including those that involve terrorism - and works to prevent criminals from perpetrating acts of terror in the first place. In fact, prevention is our number one priority. In addition, the MSP (in conjunction with other state agencies) continuously prepare to respond to terrorist incidents through its emergency planning, training and exercising efforts. Many state agencies, including the state departments of Military Affairs, Environmental Quality, Natural Resources, Transportation, and Community Health have a critical role to play in Michigan�s response and recovery plans. The MSP Emergency Management Division (EMD) is responsible for coordinating the state's response to a wide range of emergencies and disasters, both natural and manmade. While familiar hazards such as floods, tornadoes, chemical spills, wildfires, and winter storms continue to threaten public health and safety in Michigan, terrorism involving the use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction (WMD) have recently emerged as serious and disturbing threats. Recognizing that the state needs the ability to respond to terrorist events involving the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction, a WMD Regional Response Team Network (RRTN) was formed. The RRTN provides quick response capability to WMD/terrorism incidents and coordinates resources and expertise at local, state and federal levels across a wide range of disciplines. Additionally, the resources of the local teams and communities are supplemented with the Michigan Department of State Police contributing the resources and response of its Emergency Support Team and Bomb Squad. The Michigan Urban Search and Rescue (MUSAR) organization is also a critical response asset. MUSAR is a privately funded organization working in cooperation with the fire service, local emergency management, MSP and private sector agencies. MUSAR's role is to provide a statewide capability for specialized response to structural collapse emergencies and incidents requiring specialized training in search and rescue.  MUSAR is prepared to respond with specialized resources. Local governments are also preparing for a wide range of emergency situations. Local law enforcement, fire, public works, and emergency medical agencies and personnel are being trained in how to properly respond to potential terrorism incidents. In addition, communities are developing plans and procedures for such incidents, and then testing those plans and procedures in disaster exercises centered on terrorist activities. Many businesses - especially larger ones that could potentially be a target of terrorism - are developing and testing internal emergency plans and procedures and training personnel in anti-terrorism methods. These combined efforts of government, business and individual citizens form the cornerstone of Michigan�s continuing fight against terrorism. As a concerned citizen, I would like to help. What can I do? Look to help in your local community. Each county in Michigan has an emergency management program that works closely with local volunteers to deal with unmet needs in disaster situations. In New York, as in many recent disasters, the outpouring of support is commendable but can become chaotic quickly when volunteers are not trained, coordinated and managed properly. Working within your local emergency management and support groups is a great way to get trained and give back to your community. Click here to access Emergency Management Division's website for a complete list of local emergency management programs, including contact names and phone numbers. Is Michigan at risk of a terrorist attack? Terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD) pose a growing threat to the security of the United States, including Michigan. Terrorism is the use of force or violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion or ransom. Terrorists often use threats to create fear among the public, to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism, and to get immediate publicity for their causes. Learn more about the nature of terrorism to protect yourself and your family. One way governments attempt to reduce our vulnerability to terrorist incidents is by increasing security at airports and other public facilities. You can prepare to deal with a terrorist incident by learning about and adapting many of the same techniques used to prepare for other emergencies. Preparing and Protecting Your Family What can I do to be prepared? Create an emergency communications plan Choose an out-of-town contact your family or household will call or e-mail to check on each other should a disaster occur. Your selected contact should live far enough away that they would be unlikely to be directly affected by the same event, and they should know they are the chosen contact. Make sure every household member has e-mail addresses and telephone numbers (home, work, pager and cell) for the contact and each other. Leave these numbers at your children's schools and at your workplace. Your family should know that if telephones are not working, they need to be patient and try again later or try e-mail. Many people flood the telephone lines when emergencies happen but e-mail can sometimes get through when calls don't. Establish a meeting place Having a predetermined meeting place away from your home will save time and minimize confusion should your home be affected or the area evacuated. You may even want to make arrangements to stay with a family member or friend in case of an emergency. Be sure to include any pets in these plans, since pets are not permitted in shelters and some hotels will not accept them. Assemble a disaster supplies kit If you need to evacuate your home or are asked to "shelter in place," having some essential supplies on hand will make you and your family more comfortable. Prepare a disaster supplies kit in an easy-to-carry container such as a duffel bag or small plastic trash can. Include "special needs" items for any member of your household (infant formula or items for people with disabilities or older people), first aid supplies (including prescription medications), a change of clothing for each household member, a sleeping bag or bedroll for each, a battery powered radio or television and extra batteries, food and water and tools. It is also a good idea to include some cash and copies of important family documents (birth certificates, passports and licenses) in your kit. Click here to visit the Red Cross web page for more information. What if my children are at school during an emergency? In an emergency, your children may be sheltered in place or evacuated from school. If protective actions are being taken at your children's school, do not go to the school. School personnel are trained to handle emergencies. Do not call your child's school. You could tie up a phone line that is needed for emergency communications. For further information, listen to local emergency radio and TV stations to learn when and where you can pick up your children. Chemical Emergencies What do I need to know about chemical emergencies? A major chemical emergency can release a hazardous amount of a chemical into the environment. These accidents sometimes result in a fire or explosion, but many times you cannot see or smell anything unusual. Some chemicals that are safe, and even helpful in small amounts, can be harmful in larger quantities or under certain conditions. Chemical accidents do happen . . . at home and in the community. You may be exposed to a chemical in three ways: Breathing the chemical Swallowing contaminated food, water, or medication Touching the chemical, or coming into contact with clothing or things that have touched the chemical. Here is what you can do to protect yourself and your family from such exposure. How will I be notified of a chemical emergency? In the event of a major chemical emergency, you will be notified by the authorities. To get your attention, a siren could sound, you may be called by telephone, or emergency personnel may drive by and give instructions over a loudspeaker. Officials could even come to your door. Listen carefully to radio or television emergency alert stations (EAS), and strictly follow instructions. Your life could depend on it. You Will Be Told: The type of health hazard The area affected How to protect yourself Evacuation routes (if necessary) Shelter locations Type and location of medical facilities The phone numbers to call if you need extra help. Do not call the telephone company, and do not call EMS, 9-1-1, or the operator for information. Dial these numbers only for a possible life-threatening emergency. What types of protective actions could be used? Shelter in Place One of the basic instructions you may be given in a chemical emergency is to "shelter in place" - a precaution to keep you and your family safe while remaining in your home. If you are told to shelter in place: Take your children and pets indoors immediately. While gathering your family, you can provide a minimal amount of protection to your breathing by covering your mouth and nose with a damp cloth. Close all windows in your home. Turn off all fans, heating and air conditioning systems. Close the fireplace damper. Go to an aboveground room (not the basement) with the fewest windows and doors. Take your Family Disaster Supplies Kit with you. Wet some towels and jam them in the crack under the doors. Tape around doors, windows, exhaust fans or vents. Use the plastic garbage bags to cover windows, outlets, and heat registers. If you are told there is danger of explosion, close the window shades, blinds, or curtains. To avoid injury, stay away from the windows. Stay in the room and listen to your radio until you are told all is safe or you are told to evacuate. Evacuation Authorities may decide to evacuate an area for your protection. Again, it is important to stay calm, listen carefully and follow all instructions. If you are told to evacuate, listen to your radio to make sure the evacuation order applies to you and to understand if you are to evacuate immediately or if you have time to pack some essentials. Do not use your telephone. If you are told to evacuate immediately: Move quickly and calmly and take the following with you Your Family Disaster Supplies Kit and medications A change of clothing for each member of the family Medication, eyeglasses, hearing aids or dentures, or things like canes and walkers Personal items such as toothbrushes, deodorant, etc. Items for your baby such as diapers, formula, or baby food Books, puzzles or cards and games for entertainment. Close and lock your windows Shut off all vents Lock the door Do not assume that a shelter will have everything you need. In most cases, the shelters will provide only emergency items such as meals, cots, and blankets. You do not need to turn off your refrigerator or freezer, but you should turn off all other appliances and lights before locking your home as you leave. Check on neighbors to make sure they have been notified, and offer help to those with disabilities or other special needs. If you need a ride, ask a neighbor. If no neighbor is available to help you, listen to the emergency broadcast station for further instructions. Take only one car to the evacuation site. Close your car windows and air vents and turn off the heater or air conditioner. Do not take shortcuts because a shortcut may put you in the path of danger. For your safety, follow the exact route you are told to take. Preventing Biological Terrorism What is biological terrorism? Biological terrorism involves the deliberate use of biological weapons or devices intended to spread disease-producing organisms or toxins in food, water, by the use of insects, or as an aerosol. The impact of a biological weapon would depend on the characteristics of the pathogen or toxin, the design of the weapon or delivery system, the environment in which it is used, and the speed and effectiveness of the medical and public health response. Across the nation, local, state, and federal authorities are putting capabilities in place to improve the ability to detect abnormal public health problems rapidly. As the normal cold and flu season arrives in the next few months, please do not jump to the conclusion that you have been infected with a biological agent if you begin to feel achy or have the sniffles. How easy would it be for terrorists to disperse a biological agent effectively? Terrorists cannot count on just filling the delivery system with agent, pointing the device, and flipping the switch to activate it. Biological agents have extreme sensitivity to sunlight, humidity, pollutants in the atmosphere, temperature, and even exposure to oxygen, all of which can kill the microbes. What is being done to protect the public from bioterrorism? The Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) has in place a bioterrorism preparedness plan that has been funded through a multi-year grant of approximately $1.5 million per year, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for stronger public health preparedness for bioterrorism. Michigan has been preparing for how to respond in the event of a bioterrorist attack and much work has already been accomplished. Working cooperatively with the Michigan State Police, FBI, local health departments, Michigan National Guard, Emergency Medical Services representatives, Poison Control Centers, area physicians and hospitals, MDCH continues to focus on this extremely important area. The CDC funding has allowed Michigan to enhance our ability to respond to acts of bioterrorism across the entire state. This includes coordinating emergency management activities, enhancing disease detection and reporting, improving biological and chemical laboratory capacity and enhancing Michigan�s health alert network. Should I buy a gas mask? No. The Michigan Department of Community Health is not recommending the purchase of gas masks. While there has been a great amount of media attention on biological and chemical terrorism, the threat is still low. For complete protection with a gas mask, it would need to be worn all day, every day. To wear a mask continuously or �just in case� a bioterrorist attack occurs, is impractical, if not impossible. Further, a gas mask is a specialized piece of equipment that requires training and a correct professional fitting to ensure proper protection. To work effectively, masks must be specially fitted to the wearer, and wearers must be trained in their use. This is usually done for the military and for workers in industries and laboratories who face routine exposure to chemicals and germs on the job. Gas masks purchased at an Army surplus store or off the Internet carry no guarantees that they will work. More serious is the fact that the masks can be dangerous if worn incorrectly. There have even been reports of accidental suffocation when people have worn masks incorrectly. In the event that your area is threatened by a chemical or biological exposure whether by an accident or intentional release, your local community will be notified through emergency plans already in place. Do I need to get medicine to protect my children and myself? No. There have been no reports of unusual increases in illness in Michigan. If the Michigan Department of Community Health determines that there is a need for the public to receive medicine, the State of Michigan will notify residents on how and where to do this. Fortunately, many types of illnesses that could be caused by biological terrorism are treatable. If the need were to arise, federal and state public health authorities have been developing plans to ensure that medicines are quickly delivered to the public to prevent or treat these illnesses. Should I have my own supply of antibiotics? No. There is currently no justification for taking antibiotics or keeping your own supply. Antibiotics can cause side effects and should only be taken with medical supervision. Keeping a supply of antibiotics on hand can pose other problems as the antibiotics have a limited "shelf life" before they lose their strength. What is smallpox? Smallpox is a disease caused by a virus, which has not been seen outside two secure laboratories since 1980. The disease can spread from person to person. Transmission usually occurs only after the patient develops a fever and rash. Although there is no treatment for the disease, a vaccine against smallpox provides excellent protection and serves to stop the spread of the disease. While many vaccines must be given weeks or months before a person is exposed to infection, smallpox vaccine is different. It protects a person even when given 2 to 3 days after exposure to the disease and may prevent a fatal outcome even when given as late as 4 to 5 days after exposure. Smallpox was stamped out globally by 1980 and vaccination stopped everywhere in the world. Can I get the smallpox vaccine? The state�s top doctor, Michigan Department of Community Health Chief Medical Executive, David R. Johnson, M.D, explains that there have been no recommendations either nationally or from the state for the distribution of vaccines for smallpox or anthrax. He also stresses that early identification of symptoms and illness is extremely important in our efforts to effectively identify any potential bioterrorism attack, noting that while the threat is still low, if exposure is detected, medical treatment would quickly begin. The smallpox vaccine, which was removed from the commercial market in the 1980s due to the eradication of the disease, would be released only under the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to effectively treat individuals who may have been exposed to smallpox. The U.S. has a limited supply of vaccine and plans are in place at the CDC to produce new vaccine supplies. In the event that it is believed that someone has been exposed to smallpox, the CDC has plans to respond to these types of public health emergencies and will coordinate activities with the Michigan Department of Community Health to ensure the safety of you and your family. If I was vaccinated against smallpox before 1980, am I still protected? Probably not. Vaccination has been shown to wear off in most people after 10 years but may last longer if the person has been successfully vaccinated on multiple occasions. If health authorities determine that you have been exposed to smallpox or are at risk of infection, they would recommend that you be re-vaccinated immediately. What is anthrax? Anthrax is a disease caused by bacteria. Prior to control, anthrax was mostly found in animals and sometimes in humans (slaughter house workers) who handled infected animals. The form of the disease that health authorities are concerned that a bioterrorist attack might produce is inhalational anthrax. Inhalational anthrax occurs when a person breathes in anthrax spores. In the event of a bioterrorist attack, health authorities would conduct a rapid investigation, determine the place and time of the release, and identify individuals who need antibiotics. The federal government has stockpiled antibiotics for large-scale distribution in the event of a bioterrorist attack. Is anthrax contagious? No. Anthrax is not contagious. It does not spread from person to person. Healthy people who come into contact with persons sick with anthrax cannot acquire the disease. Can I get the anthrax vaccine? No, the Anthrax vaccine is not available to the general public. The vaccine is only available to the military because of the risk they may encounter in their work overseas. The risk of your exposure to Anthrax is still considered to be low. Exposure to Anthrax can be treated with early intervention and it does not spread from person to person. In the event of a possible Anthrax exposure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has in place plans to respond to these types of public health emergencies and will coordinate activities with the Michigan Department of Community Health to ensure safety. What can I do to protect my children and myself? First, we recommend that you go on with your daily activities. In the event that we become aware of situations that may be harmful to your health, the public will be notified as soon as possible. In Michigan, physicians and laboratories are required to report a variety of diseases and conditions including unusual increases of disease to local public health departments. This reporting process occurs routinely between health care providers and the local public health department serving your community. Local public health departments use this information to monitor the diseases occurring within your area. They in turn, report this information to the Michigan Department of Community Health so disease activity across the State of Michigan can be monitored. These are standard disease-reporting procedures for many diseases - not only those associated with bioterrorism. In many cases, local public health departments will follow-up with a phone call to the person who has been ill. However, a phone call from your local health department does not mean you have been exposed to bioterrorism. Follow-up is standard practice for a number of diseases occurring in Michigan. In such cases, a representative of your local public health department will ask a series of routine questions to assist them in determining who may have been exposed and the likely time and place of that exposure. Your cooperation during such follow-up will allow local public health authorities to more thoroughly monitor the types of diseases that occur in your community. How would my doctor know what symptoms to look for? Communicable disease epidemiologists continue to provide training to local health departments, physicians, nurses and other health professionals to improve their ability to detect and respond to all communicable disease outbreaks in Michigan, particularly those caused by unknown agents. What is the CDC National Pharmaceutical Stockpile? The CDC National Pharmaceutical Stockpile program has developed a national repository of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical material that they can deliver to the site of a chemical or biological terrorism event. The Michigan Department of Community Health and the Michigan State Police Emergency Management Division are developing a plan and protocols in order to effectively receive and distribute these vital supplies in Michigan if needed. I�ve received an e-mail warning about the �Klingerman Virus.� Is this true? No it is not true and is a hoax. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has received several inquiries concerning an e-mail message about people who have been infected with "Klingerman virus" after opening gift packages delivered to them in the mail. According to the e-mail message, a number of people became ill with a viral infection after handling a sponge contained in a package marked, "A gift for you from the Klingerman Foundation." There is no "Klingerman virus," and the information in the e-mail notice is untrue. If you receive an e-mail message about "Klingerman virus," please do not forward it to others. What if my fear about bioterrorism is having a serious impact on my family and work life? Given the attacks upon civilians that took place on September 11, it is reasonable for citizens to feel anxious about their personal safety. Should your fear get to the point that it stops you from doing the things you would normally do in a day, it might be helpful to talk with someone. Many people will experience a variety of reactions to the trauma and the unforgettable images from the tragedy, including feeling numb, angry, sleepless and helpless. The following tips may help you cope with the emotions and grief. Talk. Deep trauma becomes more manageable when it is verbalized. Try to find words to describe your reaction and share them with someone you trust. If you can�t talk with someone, write in a journal or diary. Do something to help. Donate blood. Send money to one of the other organizations that are helping directly. Fly an American flag or put a candle in your window to affirm your commitment that darkness will not overcome the light. Plant a tree or perennial plant to remind yourself at next year�s anniversary that life prevails. Utilize spiritual resources. Attend church, synagogue, mosque or other faith community services or vigils. Seek professional support. Additional trauma support, counseling and resources are available. Information can be found at www.madd.org, www.ncvc.org, www.pomc.org or www.try-nova.org. Safely Transporting Hazardous Materials What kind of license is needed to haul hazardous waste? Hazardous materials and hazardous wastes, as well as restrictions on commercial driver�s licenses (CDL) are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Environmental Quality, the Michigan State Police, the MSP Motor Carrier Division, and the Secretary of State�s Office. For example, the Department of Environmental Quality requires transporters of hazardous waste to obtain credentials for the truck that is used to haul the waste. These credentials are obtained by the company making application to the state for credentials to transport hazardous waste. These credentials do not evaluate the individual drivers. This activity is evaluated by the Secretary of State which requires applicants to provide multiple proofs of identity and pass written and driving tests. Should the public be concerned regarding hazardous materials that are being transported over the highways? Both hazardous materials and hazardous wastes are transported daily with little or no risk to the public. Regular shipments of gasoline, propane, acid and other substances are delivered to destinations across Michigan to meet the needs of industry and the public. State agencies have increased their inspection of both motor carriers and individuals that are licensed to transport these materials in order to ensure public safety. How available are hazardous wastes to potential terrorists? The company that generates the waste must properly document hazardous cargoes. The company then contracts with a transporter to deliver the waste to the proper treatment, storage or disposal facility. To increase security, credentialed transport companies are being advised to review their hiring practices and to be extra cautious in their transport procedures. They have also been cautioned to never leave their vehicles unattended. Security at Our Borders and Airports Has security been strengthened at the various bridges and tunnels that connect Canada to Michigan? Yes. U.S. Customs, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Michigan National Guard, local police agencies and sheriff departments, and the Michigan Department of Transportation are working cooperatively to ensure Michigan�s border with Canada is as safe and secure as possible. This requires a high security level, which involves thorough inspections of all vehicles and increased questioning of people attempting to enter the United States from Canada at the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and Ambassador Bridge in Detroit, and the International Bridge in Sault Ste. Marie. At peak travel times, this can result in delays approaching two hours, however it is more common to see delays under 20 minutes to 30 minutes at most of the crossings. The Ambassador Bridge tends to have longer delays than any other location. Delays going into Canada are generally quite short. For updated information on current conditions at any of the bridges or the tunnel, contact the MDOT Office of Communications in Lansing at 517-373-2160 or visit the U.S. Customs Web site. What is Michigan doing to heighten security at our airports? At the request of President Bush, the Governor has deployed National Guard troops to various checkpoints at Michigan�s commercial airports. These soldiers will perform a wide range of security functions, ranging from monitoring passengers to inspecting luggage. The Michigan Department of Transportation plays an oversight and regulatory role with Michigan's public-use airports, which tend to be the smaller airports with no commercial service. MDOT's Bureau of Aeronautics remains a resource for these small airports, acting as a conduit for information related to airport security at their level as provided by the Federal Aviation Administration. Keeping Our Highways Safe What is MDOT doing to protect the roads in our state from terrorist attacks? The Michigan Department of Transportation is actively reviewing the entire transportation network to closely evaluate how various components are connected and what risks exist from potential threats. Plans have been in place for some time now regarding threats to the state�s highway system. For security reasons, details of those plans are not being released to the public. Are there emergency plans available for using the highways as evacuation corridors or for access by emergency personnel during a crisis? The Michigan Department of Transportation has evacuation routes and scenarios plotted out regarding the necessary closure of part of the state�s transportation network. This includes, for example, the need to redirect traffic from a major interstate in order to protect motorists or provide easy access into or out of a community along that freeway corridor. The plans, which were originally drawn up for weather-related catastrophes, have been used from time to time to address problems caused by serious traffic accidents. The plans are kept up-to-date and are being reviewed again to ensure they are as complete as possible for any scenario that may occur. For security reasons, details of these plans are not being released to the public. What can I do if I see something that is unusual or activity I feel is suspicious while on the road? You should contact your local police agency and report anything you feel is important enough that it should be investigated by law enforcement. If you see something you perceive to be an immediate threat to public safety or the state�s transportation network, MDOT encourages you to dial 911 and report the situation to police immediately. If you have concerns about road repair or construction activities and how they relate to public safety or security, please contact your local MDOT Transportation Service Center. A listing is available on MDOT�s Web site at www.mdot.state.mi.us. Protecting Our Food and Water Could terrorists poison Michigan�s water supply? The "pill in the water supply" is a myth about chemical terrorism that is not true. All metropolitan water supplies have safeguards in place. Every day, water goes through various purification processes and is tested often. If terrorists were to attempt to poison a reservoir, they would need to disperse tons of agent into the water - smaller amounts would be diluted - and the vessels required for such a feat would be difficult to miss. Many cities have implemented heightened security around their reservoirs in order to further monitor any questionable activities. What should I do if I see a crop duster flying near my home? Aerial applicators, or �crop dusters�, are an important part of Michigan�s modern agriculture system and are a tool to help protect or enhance crop production. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has lifted its recent restrictions on aerial applicators so these planes are now flying legally. In addition, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and the FBI have met with all aerial applicators in the state to assure that equipment is secured and planes cannot be stolen by terrorists. At this time of year, aerial applicators are probably spreading wheat seeds on farm fields for the winter wheat crop, rather than spraying pesticides. If you see crop dusters flying over farm or forest areas, this is most likely a normal operation and there is nothing you need to do. However, if you observe any aircraft - not just crop dusters - flying in a suspicious or dangerous manner, contact your local law enforcement authorities or the nearest FAA office. Aerial applicators in Michigan are required to be licensed, certified and participate in continuing education credits. In addition, the Michigan Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the Michigan Agricultural Aviation Association and Michigan State University Extension, hosts an annual fly-in to conduct regulatory inspections of aircraft and spray systems, as well as to administer test flights over a line of computer-assisted instruments to ensure planes are properly calibrated. If you believe you have been exposed to a pesticide or other substance and have health-related questions, you should contact your doctor, local poison control center or local health department immediately. If you have concerns that the material being sprayed by aircraft is drifting away from its intended target, you are encouraged to call the nearest Michigan Department of Agriculture regional office in Traverse City, Grand Rapids, Saginaw, St. Joseph, Lansing or Southfield.

While we are aware of no specific threat of biological or chemical terrorism in Michigan or the United States, Michigan�s farmers and food establishments are committed to heightening security measures. The state, through the Michigan Department of Agriculture and other local, federal, university and industry partners, has a comprehensive and aggressive surveillance and inspection program in place for food and agricultural products from the farm gate to the consumer plate. In fact, food and dairy inspectors conduct thorough, regular inspections of on farm operations, food processing facilities, grocery stores, restaurants and other food establishments across the state. In addition, the Michigan Department of Agriculture has a state-of-the-art laboratory system that routinely samples and tests both raw agricultural commodities and finished food products for pesticide residues and food-borne pathogens. The Michigan Departments of Agriculture and Community Health have also collectively developed a response plan for food-related emergencies, including how the agencies will work closely together to identify incidents early and initiate control measures promptly. Consumers with food safety-related questions may contact the Michigan Department of Agriculture toll-free at 800-292-3939 or the nearest MDA regional office in Traverse City, Grand Rapids, Saginaw, St. Joseph, Lansing or Southfield.

What can I do to ensure that my products continue to be safely and securely stored and properly used? Agricultural chemicals and pesticides are used safely and properly in Michigan to help farmers control pests, reduce associated risks to public health, and produce high-quality products. Under certain circumstances, however, these materials can be hazardous and pose a threat to public health and safety. With that in mind, the Michigan Department of Agriculture asks those who manufacture, transport, store, sell, distribute and use agricultural chemicals or pesticides to be especially vigilant for suspicious activity and to be extremely proactive in all security measures. All agricultural chemical and pesticide businesses and applicators should review their individual security/management practices. In developing or reviewing a personal checklist of proper storage and usage for various materials, the following are a good guide. Ensure storage areas are secure and locked as appropriate. Be aware of who has keys and/or access to storage areas. Restrict access of non-employees (deliveries, maintenance, etc.) to facilities. Regularly inspect storage facilities and maintain an inspection log. Keep precise inventory records of products currently and readily available. Secure and/or lock application equipment when not in use. Keep a list of all emergency phone numbers readily available, including all fire, law enforcement and medical contacts. Immediately report all unusual purchases, suspicious activity, vehicles, people, theft, sabotage and vandalism to local law enforcement authorities. I'm a farmer or a food processor. What should I be doing to minimize potential threats of biological or chemical terrorism? We are aware of no specific threat of biological or chemical terrorism in Michigan or the United States. However, it is prudent that you and your operation be especially diligent in establishing and maintaining appropriate security measures to help ensure the health and safety of the people, animals and products that may be entering or leaving your premises. Limiting access to farm or food production areas is a well-recognized method of safeguarding the health of both farm crops and herds. Michigan law also requires managers of food establishments to exclude unnecessary persons from food preparation and food storage areas. Now would be a good time to review your operation's security measures and safety procedures. Appropriate security measures consist of conducting a comprehensive review of your farm or facility, including all structures, equipment, parking areas, personnel with access, alarm systems, emergency power systems, employee-visitor identification, communications, perimeter security and contingency plans. All product inventories and shipments should also be closely tracked. Specifically for livestock operations, animals, including those in pasture, should be monitored regularly. Any unusual behavior or symptoms of disease should be reported immediately to your veterinarian. You should also ensure that your employees have been trained in, and consistently practice, your operation's security measures. Some other suggestions to keep in mind and to help you develop your individual biosecurity plans: (1) have a list of all emergency contacts on hand, and ensure that it's appropriately posted and personnel are aware of it; (2) report all suspicious activities, vehicles, people, thefts, inventory shortages or missing products, sabotage to facilities or equipment, and vandalism or activities that may pose a safety or security risk. All reports should be made to your local law enforcement authorities. In addition, each county has an Emergency Management Coordinator who may be contacted to provide guidance to you and your operation in developing security and emergency plans.

While no industry is totally immune to the risk of disruptions to production facilities, electric and natural gas utilities, and the petroleum industry have all taken steps to increase security. Natural gas and electric utilities also have a number of emergency procedures in place to quickly respond to any disruption in their ability to meet customers� needs, whether that occurs as a result of storm damage, equipment failure, or a terrorist attack. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) monitors the state�s overall energy supply and demand, tracks energy prices, and has contingency plans available to address energy shortages. Under state law, the Governor has the power to declare an energy emergency that would permit him to quickly address an energy supply disruption. The Chairman of the MPSC also serves as Chair of the interdepartmental Energy Advisory Committee, which was established by the Energy Emergency Act. MPSC staff also works closely with the Emergency Management Division of the State Police, the U.S. Department of Energy, and other Midwest states to make sure we maintain a good understanding of our energy supply position. Should I be concerned about gasoline supplies in Michigan? Midwest gasoline supplies have been tight and prices have shown considerable volatility over the last year; however, supplies are currently adequate to meet the needs of Michigan�s motorists. The events of September 11th created a considerable amount of uncertainty and resulted in some panic buying which was fueled by a some retail gas stations raising prices to unwarranted levels. The state�s Attorney General has moved to take action against any gasoline station that may have violated the Michigan Consumer Protection Laws. The surge in demand from panic buying on September 11th did cause some stations to temporarily run out of gasoline. A repeat of this problem can be avoided if consumers simply buy gasoline as they would normally. This will avoid lines from forming at gas stations, pushing up prices even more. Gasoline inventories in the Midwest are in excess of 2 billion gallons that can be drawn down as needed to meet demand or a temporary loss of supply. Furthermore, the Midwest has weathered two unanticipated temporary closings of major refineries in the last year without significant problems at the retail level. While no facility is invulnerable, refineries and pipelines have increased security at their facilities to assure that they are not readily available targets for terrorists. Petroleum tankers are also subject to increased random checks by the State Police, Motor Carrier Division as part of an increased focus on vehicles hauling dangerous products on Michigan highways. In the event of an international oil supply disruption, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy can be tapped. This reserve contains about 545 million barrels of crude oil that can be drawn down at a rate of up to 4.1 million barrels a day if necessary. What about electric power - could the lights go off? On most days Michigan has more electric generation inside the state than is required to meet demand. In addition, the Michigan electric system is heavily interconnected through transmission lines with electric generation throughout the Midwest. By design, these reserves enable the electric system to reliably deliver power even with substantial losses of generation or transmission equipment. Such losses typically are due to weather, maintenance work, or random equipment failures, but could also include acts of sabotage. Electric utilities have long maintained extensive security programs designed to protect critical components of the infrastructure from acts of sabotage. These programs have been upgraded over the years and are currently on maximum alert. All these features combine to make significant long-term interruptions of power less likely due to acts of sabotage or terrorism. What about security at nuclear power plants? In response to concerns about nuclear power plant vulnerability, plant owners have implemented additional security measures at Michigan nuclear power plants. This was done in response to requirements of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in cooperation with the MPSC and other state agencies. Could natural gas supplies needed to heat my home be affected? It would be difficult to cause a major disruption to natural gas supplies in Michigan, although nothing is impossible. Michigan has the capability to store large amounts of natural gas in underground wells for use in meeting the state�s peak winter heating needs. Like the electric system, the gas system has redundancy built in that help assure reliable supply even when unanticipated events occur. The utilities can also reroute pipeline supply when a pipeline is shut down for any reason. Utilities have procedures in place to quickly replace sections of a damaged pipeline, which occurs from time to time for numerous reasons. The MPSC�s Gas Division has a Gas Safety Section that works closely with the U.S. Department of Transportation�s Office of Pipeline Safety that carefully monitors the operation of pipelines in Michigan. The MPSC also has field engineers that are prepared to go on site as needed to address pipeline safety matters. Protecting State Personnel and Facilities What steps are being taken to increase security in state buildings? State-owned buildings now have limited, monitored and guarded access for employees and visitors. Employees must show state identification and visitors must sign in (and sign out) and show photo identification. Packages are being inspected before delivery to the offices. Access to delivery ramps and parking structures has been limited and guards are checking deliveries and automobiles. The state is also working with the landlords of leased buildings where the state maintains offices and personnel to strengthen security and asks employees to still wear photo ID. What is the state doing to combat cyberterrorism? The state is positioned to combat cyberterrorism on two fronts. First, by protecting its systems and resources from exposure to potential terrorism threats, and second, by emphasizing the role each individual employee who uses and/or accesses the systems must play in helping to protect state assets. Cyberterrorism is the use of computing resources to intimidate or coerce others for political or social gains that are contrary to democracy. An example of cyberterrorism could be sending viruses or worms that either destroy information or paralyze servers with millions of e-mails. To combat cyberterrorism, the state took action several months ago to enhance the protective shield surrounding data systems and facilities. Acknowledging that there are no foolproof ways to totally protect a system short of not giving access to anyone, the state has prudently developed a total systems approach that balances an acceptable-risk security environment with the openness to access required of a public institution. Michigan�s approach features five building blocks: identification, authentication, authorization/access, administration, and auditing. Individually, these blocks do not form a barrier against terrorism, however, together they form the foundation of a strong defense against attacks. The identification of a trusted agent desiring to access state systems, authentication that validates the trusted agent is who they say they are, establishing pre-approved access rights, administration of the entire process, and performing audits to ensure compliance with existing policies, procedures, and standards. The state has policies and procedures that help limit its exposure to viruses/worms and hacking attempts. As part of its ongoing support of state business operations the state's technology, security and operational plans are continually updated and refined based on changing environments and significant events. Once a virus or worm is detected, network administrators also request that employees check to make sure they have the latest version of the virus protection program they are running for additional measure. The second front on fighting cyberterrorism is the awareness and education of personal responsibilities of all internal system users. To be effective, each user is encouraged to take a personal interest in the need for security and to recognize that security is only as strong as its weakest link. A few key items that help to protect against cyber-terrorism include these steps: All accounts must have passwords and the passwords should be unusual, difficult to guess. If something appears out of the ordinary and/or looks suspicious in or around a technology facility, they are asked to notify the security office and their supervisor. Employees are encouraged to take a personal interest in learning about what can be done to help minimize the affects of cyberterrorism by contacting their local systems administrator and/or computer security officer.
