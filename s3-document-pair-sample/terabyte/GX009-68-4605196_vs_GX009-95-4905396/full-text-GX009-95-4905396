Dot Com Disclosures: Example 1 The disclosure "imitation" needs to accompany the triggering term "pearl" so that consumers are not misled about the type of pearls being sold. The disclosure would not be as effective if it was separated from the word pearl or placed on a different page. The FTCs Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries, 16 C.F.R. � 23.19, recognize this and advise that the disclosure "imitation" immediately precede the word pearl. In this situation, there is no reason to evaluate proximity differently in Internet ads than with other types of ads.
