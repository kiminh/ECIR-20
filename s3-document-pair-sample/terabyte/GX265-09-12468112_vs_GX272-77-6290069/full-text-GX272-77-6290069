E - 1 ALPHABETICAL LIST OF DATA ITEMS ............................................................ F - 1 GENERAL INFORMATION The Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) provides a data file which contains selected financial and utilization data from the Long-term Care Facility Integrated Disclosure and Medi-Cal Cost Reports (Disclosure Report) submitted by California long-term care facilities. This data file is available for purchase on PC diskette and for downloading from the Office's web-site (www.oshpd.state.ca.us). Due to the large number of data elements reported on the Disclosure Report, only a maximum of 212 selected data items for each reporting facility are provided. We tried to provide a wide range of commonly used data items, including general facility information, utilization data by payer, revenue data by payer and type of care, expense data by cost center, financial ratios, and labor information. A list of additional information that can be calculated using data items from the data file is located in Appendix B, Calculations and Formulas. We realize that the limited number of data items may preclude some data users from performing detailed analysis of a facility's report, in which case more detailed data can be obtained by contacting OSHPD's Healthcare Information Resource Center at (916) 322-2814 or at hirc@oshpd.state.ca.us. The data file includes selected data from each Disclosure Report that was submitted within the specified range of reporting periods. This means that if a facility submitted two Disclosure Reports within the specified range, both reports are included. These situations arise due to changes in facility licensure or fiscal year end date. As a general rule, most reports will cover a 12 month (365 day) reporting period, although some reports will be less than or greater than 12 months. OSHPD routinely grants reporting modifications to reflect the unique operating characteristics of certain facilities. These modifications may include the submission of an abbreviated Disclosure Report in lieu of the full 13-page Disclosure Report. Since the data file contains data from all facilities that submitted a report, you should exercise caution when using the data from these "non-comparable" reports. To assist you in identifying these reports, the data file contains a data field (Item 7, "Comparable") which indicates if the facility is considered "comparable." Additionally, Appendix D contains a list of "non-comparable" facilities and a description of each facility. Data File Availability An updated data file is released two times per year (around October 1st and April 1st). Each file contains data from report periods that ended within the specified 12 month period. This file contains up to 212 data items on each of the 103 facilities that submitted a Disclosure Report to OSHPD for fiscal years ending July 1, 2000 through December 30, 2000. A separate file with facilities with fiscal years ending December 31, 2000 through June 30, 2001 is available. i GENERAL INFORMATION Data File Documentation This documentation is available in hardcopy, or on the OSHPD web-site (www.oshpd.state.ca.us) in a PDF file format. Included in this documentation package are the definitions of the data items from the Disclosure Report and a description of each data item (field). The six appendices are: A) a cross-reference between each data item and the Disclosure Report; B) formulas for other items that can be calculated using the data items in the data file; C) a cross-reference list between counties, Health Service Areas, and Health Facility Planning Areas; D) a list of non-comparable facilities; E) a list of alternate data item titles; and F) an alphabetical list of all data items. Standard Data File Format The file is in a text format (.TXT) with comma-delimited/comma-separated values, which can easily be imported into most spreadsheets and databases as well as other software. (For users of LOTUS software, we can create a compressed format LOTUS file as a PKZIP� self-extracting file.) The first record (row) contains column titles that can be used as database names or spreadsheet titles. The titles are unique for each column and are 10 characters or less. If your database can accommodate only eight characters, see Appendix D, Alternate Field Titles, for suggested data titles. If you are having or believe you will have trouble processing the .TXT file format, please contact a technical representative in OSHPD's Healthcare and Information Resource Center at (916) 3222814, and indicate your concerns. We attempted to produce a data product that will meet the needs of most data users, but do not want to exclude anyone from gaining access to the data. Diskette Size Diskettes are available that filed a Disclosure on IBM or compatible minimum of 640Kb of only in 3 1/2" (1.44Mb). The diskette will contain data for each facility Report during the specified range of reporting periods. They can be used PCs operating under DOS Version 2.0 or higher with a recommended memory. Should you be unable to process the 1.44Mb diskette, contact Healthcare Information Resource Center to make arrangements for special request processing. This may entail additional time and expense. Data File Description Each line (row) represents one facility. For technical and practical reasons, we were unable to include all data elements from each submitted Disclosure Report. The 212 selected data items (columns) represent the data for 103 Disclosure Reports and reflect those data items that are in ii GENERAL INFORMATION highest demand. Some data items, such as the financial ratios, are calculations based on reported data. PKZIP� Self-Extracting File (for LOTUS software) If you are using LOTUS software, the data file is a PKZIP� self-extracting file and should have an extension of .EXE. To execute and expand this file, please follow these instructions: 1. 2. 3. 4. Insert the diskette into your A: drive. Copy the zipped file from the diskette to your designated drive that has the available space to hold the unzipped (expanded) file. For most users, this will be your C: drive. Switch to the directory or subdirectory in which you wish to expand the zipped file. At the prompt, type the filename and extension: C:> filename.EXE and press . The file will execute and expand, and is now ready to be used.

This ratio indicates how well operating assets are used to generate patient revenue. Assets to Equity Ratio - Total assets (Item 129) divided by total equity (Item 133). This ratio indicates the extent to which equity levels are used to support assets and generate future earnings. If the value is too high, the facility may be undercapitalized; if too low, the facility may be overcapitalized. A value of 4 or 5 is a well-capitalized condition.

Since the data file contains data from all facilities which submitted a report, you should exercise caution when using the data from these "non-comparable" facilities. We have included the following list and description of the facilities which are considered non-comparable. D-1 APPENDIX D - NON-COMPARABLE FACILITIES Data items belonging to the following "non-comparable" facilities may not correspond comparably with long-term care facilities in general. Caution should be used when comparing these facilities with "comparable" facilities, and in including their data in statewide totals or other groupings. A. Facilities Without Direct Patient Revenues There are no facilities in this data file that operates without direct patient revenues. B. Facility Operated by Governmental Agencies There are no facilities in this data file that are operated by the Veterans Administration of California. C. Congregate Living Health Facilities (CLHFs) and SNF-Based Hospices Data from 2 CLHFs and SNF-based hospices are included in this data file.

These facilities are identified as either "SNF/RES" or "ICF/RES" in Item 11, License Category. Caution should be used when comparing the data for these facilities, and when including their data in the statewide totals.
