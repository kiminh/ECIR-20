Longtime Shakespeare Theatre Company-Studio Theatre actor Ted van Griethuysen holds forth at Studio — and on Monday night he’ll receive this year’s Helen Hayes Tribute during the 33rd annual Hayes Awards.

CONTINUING
Yesenia Iglesias and Shravan Amin in Constellation Theatre Company's "The Arabian Nights." (Daniel Schwartz)
“The Arabian Nights.” “Typically, Allison Arkell Stockman’s ‘Arabian Nights’ looks great, and the performers undulate and swirl to the various pulsations supplied by Tom Teasley, who is visible amid a semicircle of instruments at the back of the stage. Veronica del Cerro centers the action as a fervent, persuasive Scheherezade, calming the wounded vengeance of the prince (an imposing, brooding Ryan Sellers) who beheads mistresses until her pointed stories beguile and soften him. Stockman’s second act is especially compelling: the antsy tone turns reflective, and a late scene about the power of art becomes a beautiful fugue of voices.” (Nelson Pressley) Through June 4 at Source, 1835 14th St. NW. Tickets $20-$45. Call 202-204-7800 or visit constellationtheatre.org .
“Building the Wall.” The brand-new play from Robert Schenkkan (of the LBJ drama “All the Way”), written in the heat of the Trump victory. “How bad could things get? Schenkkan methodically walks us through a series of policy initiatives and plausible public catastrophes to cook up a gruesome dystopia akin to the 20th and 21st century’s cruelest atrocities. Schenkkan plays cat-and-mouse with the audience, teasing out information in mere teaspoons as a white male prisoner named Rick — some sort of marked man by governmental higher-ups — gets interviewed by Gloria, a black female historian. The final third of the show’s uninterrupted 90-minute conversation is compelling as a thought experiment. It’s anti-Trump, all right.” (Nelson Pressley) May 18-27 at the Silver Spring Black Box Theatre, 8641 Colesville Rd., Silver Spring. Tickets $18-$38. Call 301-588-8279 or visit forum-theatre.org.
“Five Lesbians Eating a Quiche.” Craving kitsch? This wide-eyed camp fest will still leave you feeling empty. The setting is 1956 with repressed sexuality bursting at the seams, which leads to a saucy quiche-eating bit and to the small conscripted-into-the-action audience delaring out loud, “I am a lesbian!” Monumental Theatre Company’s five actresses display more comic moxie than does the Evan Linder-Andrew Hobgood script, which is pregnant with gags about egg supremacy and the evils of meat. This pocket-sized 75 minute performance does, however, feature one of the best gross-out laughs of the season. Through May 22 at the Atlas Performing Arts Center, 1333 H St. NE. Tickets $30. Call or visit monumentaltheatre.org.
“Forgotten Kingdoms.” “A tale of a troubled American missionary family and their circle of acquaintances on an isolated Indonesian island, ‘Forgotten Kingdoms’ touches on such themes as culture clash, the legacy of colonialism and competition among religions, but it is far from an issue play. Bold, often poignant and sometimes too leisurely, the work extends an appealingly personal and idiosyncratic vision, rich in telling detail. The title may reference forgetting, but the play often seems as clear and specific as a total-recall memory.” (Celia Wren) Through May 21 at the Atlas Performing Arts Center, 1333 H St. NE. Tickets $20-$30. Call 202-399-7993 or visit rorschachtheatre.com.
“In the Heights.” The Spanish language premiere of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s 2008 Tony-winning hip-hop musical, foreshadowing his “Hamilton” success. “You can feel the influence of ‘Rent’ in this first foray by Miranda onto Broadway. . . . The emphasis on personality manifested in song doesn’t always lend itself to a satisfying caliber of storytelling. And yet like ‘Rent,’ there is a larger story here worth telling: how the city forges families that transcend bloodlines. A party is what ‘In the Heights’ strives to be. Director Luis Salgado’s choreography gives the young, vibrant ensemble at GALA a platform to show off the best dancing in town — some of the best you may ever see in these parts.” (Peter Marks) Through May 21 at GALA Hispanic Theatre, 3333 14th St. NW. Tickets $60. Call 202-234-7174 or visit galatheatre.org.
Lisa Hodsoll in "Laura Bush Killed a Guy," now playing at Caos on F. (Ryan Smith)
“Laura Bush Killed a Guy.” “Shows off the blazing presence and comic flair of Lisa Hodsoll, who portrays a reminiscing former first lady. Dressed in a white suit, hands often demurely folded, she talks directly to the audience, shooting periodic loving glances at a photo of George W. on the wall. She radiates steely, self-satisfied graciousness — except when she reveals a subversive streak . . . The play obviously intends to disorient audiences and blur the line between fact and fiction, but it doesn’t accomplish these goals in a revelatory manner. Still, Hodsoll’s performance is to relish.” (Celia Wren) Through June 4 at Caos on F, 923 F St NW. Tickets $25-$35. Call 202-215-6993 or visit theklunch.com.
“Macbeth.” “Director Liesl Tommy’s action-packed production is a tale of Africa suffering at the hands of Western interventionists. It is never more alive than during its battles; this show is notably fluent in the vocabulary of African violence. Child soldiers? Yes — that’s who Macbeth recruits to assassinate his erstwhile sidekick Banquo and Banquo’s son. Necklacing? Yes — a tire is tossed over the head of a victim and doused with gasoline as she’s wrestled offstage. Even so, as ‘Macbeth’ productions go, this is not unusually violent or especially bloody. Nor is it particularly engaging, emotionally. The CIA-like witches have a lot of sway here, and Hecate — their boss, not typically the most memorable character in the play — is the ultimate puppet master, in a torn-from-the-headlines twist.” (Nelson Pressley) Through May 28 at Sidney Harman Hall, 610 F St. NW. Tickets $44-$118, subject to change. Call 202-547-1122 or visit shakespearetheatre.org .
“Master Class.” “Ilona Dulaski is channeling a temperamental Maria Callas in Terrence McNally’s ‘Master Class,’ directed by Nick Olcott. Dressed in black, with pearls and thick eyeliner, this version of the celebrity opera singer frets, fumes and showboats in hugely diverting fashion. Dulaski’s prima donna is a derecho windstorm of a VIP. But now and then, when she fleetingly dodders, or loses her train of thought, she becomes a poignant figure.” Through June 11 at MetroStage, 1201 N. Royal St., Alexandria. Tickets $55-$60. Call 703-548-9044 or visit metrostage.org.
“The Most Spectacular Lamentable Trial of Miz Martha Washington.” The new troupe Ally Theatre plants a flag with the mischeivous historical fantasia from Philadelphia’s James Ijames. Through May 20 at Joe’s Movement Emporium, 3309 Bunker Hill Rd., Mt. Rainier. Tickets $25. Visit allytheatrecompany.com.
Susan Marie Rhea and Brandon McCoy in "Outside Mullingar.” (Cameron Whitman)
“Outside Mullingar.” “A sweet piece of writing. Kevin Adams is Tony, a cantankerous old man who might not leave his farm to his moody son Anthony, a 40ish man played with a hangdog mope by lanky Brandon McCoy. Rena Cherry Brown tartly plays a widow whose daughter Rosemary (Susan Marie Rhea, neatly alternating currents of thoughtfulness and sheer force) is the rural Irish county’s enigma: lovely, strong, and willfully alone. Moonstruck savages might be a fair description of John Patrick Shanley’s misfit romantics, and you’ll find yourself grinning as Keegan Theatre’s quartet adeptly taps the flinty, winsome style.” (Nelson Pressley) Through May 28 at the Keegan Theatre, 1742 Church St. NW. Tickets $35-$45. Call 202-265-3767 or visit keegantheatre.com .
“Ragtime.” “‘Make them hear you,’ goes the climactic chorus in the musical ‘Ragtime,’ and the new production at Ford’s Theatre stirringly delivers on the kaleidoscopic show’s cries for justice. The setting is 1906, but the issues ring true throughout the 1998 musical’s crusading score. . . . As its cast of two dozen swarms up and down a three-story set layered with class implications, Peter Flynn’s production utilizes the full volume of the large Ford’s stage. Ford’s keeps displaying a knack for putting local actors into the right big roles, and as a composed, powerful Coalhouse, McAllister emerges as the soul of the show.” (Nelson Pressley) Through May 20 at Ford’s Theatre, 511 10th St. NW. Tickets $18-$71. Call 202-347-4833 or visit fords.org.
“Smart People.” “A tidy geometry of gender and race takes shape right away in the Arena Stage production of Lydia R. Diamond’s bright, acerbic comedy. Two men: one black, one white. Two women: one black, one Asian American. See how different combinations of ethnic and/or sexual lines parallel, bisect or glance off in tangents. . . . ‘Smart People’ doesn’t muddle much with subtext: this is the sort of comedy where everyone is completely capable of saying exactly what they think. That should be an advantage, but the dialogue is oddly delivered at lecture hall levels in Seema Sueko’s visually slick production. Luckily, Diamond’s dialogue is as clever as the title promises, and her characters press through initial assumption-laden encounters to — well, whole new levels of assumption-laden encounters.” (Nelson Pressley) Through May 21 at Arena Stage, 1101 Sixth St. NW. Tickets $40-$101, Subject to change. Call 202-488-3300 or visit arenastage.org.
CLOSING
“Fun Home,” making its Washington, D.C., premiere at the National Theatre through May 13. (Joan Marcus)
“Brighton Beach Memoirs.” The season’s second revival of one of Neil Simon’s 1980s autobiographical trilogy, following “Broadway Bound” at 1st Stage. “Susan Rome’s portrait of the harried, controlling Kate is an ­invaluable anchoring force in ­director Matt Torney’s production. Few of the other actors embed their characters quite as deeply and seamlessly in the world of Neil Simon’s semi-autobiographical play, about a cash-strapped household in 1937 Brooklyn. Still, it’s a pleasant production, well stocked with funny, absorbing moments and boasting a couple of notably persuasive turns by young actors.” (Celia Wren) Through May 14 at Theater J, 1529 16th St. NW. Tickets $15-$57. Call 202-777-3210 or visit theaterj.org.
“Dorian’s Closet.” A new musical based on the real-life female impersonator Dorian Corey, featured in the 1991 documentary “Paris Is Burning.” “The line ‘I’m workin’ here’ might almost be the motto of this methodical musical, which features a book and lyrics by Richard Mailman and music by Ryan Haase. Loosely based on a true story involving a violent death, a macabre discovery and a charismatic female impersonator, the tale has mystery and razzle-dazzle, and Haase’s score is infectiously moody. But the lyrics can be flat and the dialogue scenes often register as planned-out and stilted. As directed in less-than-flowing fashion by Joseph W. Ritsch, ‘Dorian’s Closet’ labors sedulously to explain its subject — and you can feel the effort.” (Celia Wren) Through May 14 at Rep Stage, 10901 Little Patuxent Pkwy., Columbia. Tickets $40. Call 443-518-1500 or visit repstage.org.
“Fun Home.” “The traveling incarnation of the Tony-winning musical that occupies the National Theatre for the next 3½ weeks is not only a first-rate representation of the work of composer Jeanine Tesori and book writer and lyricist Lisa Kron. It also in some significant ways constitutes a more powerful evening than was built at off-Broadway’s Public Theater in 2013 and transferred to Broadway for an 18-month run. . . . ‘Fun Home’ is a musical about initiations and discoveries, orbiting around the sorrow that adheres to the adult Alison (a terrific Kate Shindle) as she reflects on the secret life and ghastly suicide of her father, Bruce (Robert Petkoff, in an invigorating, unsentimental performance). The dad, a closeted gay English teacher who cruises bars, tries to seduce students and, seemingly inexplicably, retains the loyalty of his wife, Helen (Susan Moniz, also excellent), is such an enigma that it takes three Alisons to retrace his erratic steps.” (Peter Marks) Through May 13 at the National Theatre, 1321 Pennsylvania Ave. NW. Tickets $48-$98. Call 202-628-6161 or visit thenationaldc.org.
“The Magic Play.” A rolling premiere by “Colossal” playwright Andrew Hinderaker, created with lead actor Brett Schneider. “Schneider is a real magician, the kind who buries your chosen card in a flurry of shuffling and makes it hop to the top of the deck anyway, just for openers . . . Hinderaker has an eye for inside information, for art and craft, and for characters who lose themselves in the absorbing calling of their professions. ‘Colossal’ dramatized a fervent, dedicated, conflicted young man paralyzed by a football injury. In ‘The Magic Play,’ Schneider’s character — called the Magician — is paralyzed by the wreckage of a breakup with his lover, who got tired of being played like a deck of cards.” (Nelson Pressley) Through May 14 at the Olney Theatre Center, 2001 Olney-Sandy Spring Rd., Olney. Tickets $20-$70. Call 301-924-3400 or visit olneytheatre.org.
