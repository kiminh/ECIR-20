CONTINUING
“Back to Methuselah.” From the Shavian specialists at the Washington Stage Guild, the final third of George Bernard Shaw’s epic-length futuristic saga, following Part 1 in 2014 and Part 2 in 2015. “If this now feels like inside baseball for hardcore followers of George Bernard Shaw, that was always to be expected. The five-part play — split into thirds by the Stage Guild — about dumb humankind trying to grow up is unnervingly long and unapologetically intellectual . . . A generally static yet smartly acted show, directed by Bill Largess with a keen ear for the thrust of Shavian arguments.” (Nelson Pressley) Through April 16 at the Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church, 900 Massachusetts Ave. NW. Tickets $25-$60. Call 202-347-9620 or visit stageguild.org
“Dry Land.” A drama about two teen girls — one of them with an unwanted pregnancy — by young writer Ruby Rae Spiegel; part of Forum Theatre’s “Nasty Women Rep” with “What Every Girl Should Know.” A “heartbreaking and often funny play, artfully directed by Amber Paige McGinnis . . . Though it barely strays from its main locker-room setting, the play offers vivid glimpses of the society that has left Amy and Ester feeling uncertain, vulnerable, rushed and judged, but neither hopeless nor helpless.” (Celia Wren) Through April 15 at the Silver Spring Black Box Theater, 8641 Colesville Rd. Tickets $18-$38. Call (301) 588-8279 or visit forum-theatre.org.
Aakhu TuahNera Freeman as Elaine Matthews and Hannah Yelland as Valerie Plame in Jacqueline E. Lawton’s "Intelligence" at Arena Stage. (C. Stanley Photography)
“Intelligence.” Arena Stage takes on the Valerie Plame affair in this premiere by Jacqueline E. Lawton. “That ‘Intelligence’ seeks with the dignified stoicism of Greek drama to recount some key American policy failures — and also the betrayal of Plame by her employers — is a mark in its favor. Still, the 90-minute piece never develops any galvanizing momentum or a thesis that helps us understand what about the Plame affair requires this particular treatment. As a result, ‘Intelligence’ proves of little more use in learning about the case than consulting Wikipedia.” (Peter Marks) Through April 9 at Arena Stage, 1101 Sixth St. SW. Tickets $90-$110. Call 202-488-3300 or visit arenastage.org.
“Midwestern Gothic.” A brand new musical thriller set in a small town, with music by Josh Schmidt (composer of “The Adding Machine”) and book by the busy librettist Royce Vavrek. Through April 30 at Signature Theatre, 4200 Campbell Ave., Arlington. Tickets $40-$100. Call 703-820-9771 or visit sigtheatre.org.
“Mnemonic.” Theater Alliance creates its own staging of the 1999 devised piece by London’s Complicite. “Although memory is a major motif in ‘Mnemonic,’ as the title suggests, the play is concerned more broadly with efforts to ferret out the past. Because the past in ‘Mnemonic’ brims with tales of people crossing borders, the play implicitly counters the isolationist and nationalist sentiment that’s widespread in today’s world. Nevertheless, it’s hard to connect emotionally . . . The very competent performances and the serviceable stage pictures never allow the potential poetry to achieve liftoff.” (Celia Wren) Through April 9 at the Anacostia Playhouse, 2020 Shannon Pl. SE. Tickets $30-$40. Call 202-290-2328 or visit theateralliance.com.
“The Night Alive.” Irish playwright Conor McPherson’s popular drama of a down-and-outer who takes in a battered woman gets its third D.C. area staging in two seasons, this time from Scena Theatre. Through April 9 at the Atlas Performing Arts Center, 1333 H St. NE. Tickets $20-$40. Call 202-399-7993 or visit scenatheatre.org.
“No Sisters.” Aaron Posner (“Stupid F-ing Bird,” “Life Sucks”) continues his string of free-spirited Chekhov adaptations. “It’s a clever, cerebral theater game that playwright-director Posner constructs — especially since simultaneously, in another theater downstairs, a production of the actual ‘Three Sisters’ is going on. This requires those seven actors (and an eighth), to commute between the two shows, repeatedly entering in ‘No Sisters’ after points at which they exit from ‘Three Sisters.’ You got that? The complicated logistics make it reverential fun: six television monitors are perched on the ‘No Sisters’ stage so that we can see ‘Three Sisters’ unfolding and they can tell when it’s their cues.” (Peter Marks) Through April 23 at Studio Theatre, 1501 14th St. NW. Tickets $20-$80. Call 202-332-3300 or visit studiotheatre.org.
Michael Innocenti as Leo Frank in "Parade." (Cameron Whitman)
“Parade.” Fascinating to see this Jason Robert Brown-Alfred Uhry musical — fleeting on Broadway in 1998-99, and staged by Ford’s Theatre in 2011 — open at the same time as Ford’s lavish “Ragtime.” The heavy thematic lift of “Parade,” about the 1913 anti-Semitic lynching of Leo Frank in Georgia, is less durable than the comparably serious, comparably epic “Ragtime” (so many righteous anthems!): the crime is outrageous, but the red-faced mob is brutish and the racist railroading is rote. The songs labor to rouse indignation, but the effort doesn’t pay — and Keegan’s earnest low-budget staging, featuring little more than broad swatches of bland light, lacks style. Nice to hear a nearly 10 peiece orchestra playing the robust score, though, and the two leads — Michael Innocenti as a flinty Frank and Eleanor J. Todd as his wife — are terrific. (Nelson Pressley) April 15 at Keegan Theater, 1742 Church Street NW. Tickets $45-$55. Call 202-265-3767 or visit keegantheatre.com
“Ragtime.” “‘Make them hear you,’ goes the climactic chorus in the musical ‘Ragtime,’ and the new production at Ford’s Theatre stirringly delivers on the kaleidoscopic show’s cries for justice. The setting is 1906, but the issues ring true throughout the 1998 musical’s crusading score . . . As its cast of two dozen swarms up and down a three-story set layered with class implications, Peter Flynn’s production utilizes the full volume of the large Ford’s stage. Ford’s keeps displaying a knack for putting local actors into the right big roles, and as a composed, powerful Coalhouse, McAllister emerges as the soul of the show.” (Nelson Pressley) Through May 20 at Ford’s Theatre, 511 10th St. NW. Tickets $18-$71. Call 202-347-4833 or visit fords.org.
“Suffrage Plays.” Short Edwardian plays connected to the suffrage movement. “Rough-hewed but interesting . . . There’s a timeliness in these plays, which were written between 1908 and 1914 as ‘unapologetic propaganda pieces,’ as ‘The Methuen Drama Book of Suffrage Plays’ (this show’s source book) puts it. The fervor behind the scripts seems to echo the fervor that has prompted some contemporary feminists to embrace the term ‘nasty women.’” (Celia Wren) Through April 9 at Venus Theater, 21 C St., Laurel. Tickets $20-$40. Call 866-811-4111 or visit venustheatre.org
“Three Sisters.” Anton Chekhov’s play directed by Jackson Gay, sharing a cast and running simultaneously with Aaron Posner’s new “No Sisters.” “Not only drags, it’s also a bit of a lightweight drag. Our encounter with the passive, aristocratic sisters and their stultifying existences has to live in an air of compelling distress. ‘It’s hard to say what is “off” about them,’ Anﬁsa the maid, played expertly by Nancy Robinette, rightly observes in ‘No Sisters.’ Which means that if the ennui and melancholy of Olga (Bridget Flanery), Masha (Caroline Hewitt) and Irina (Emilie Krause) are not leavened by some bittersweet sense of complexity and mystery, there is nothing much to savor.” (Peter Marks) Through April 23 at Studio Theatre, 1501 14th St. NW. Tickets $20-$80. Call 202-332-3300 or visit studiotheatre.org.
Elizabeth Pierotti (left) and Audrey Bertaux in Lisa Kron’s "Well" at 1st Stage. (Teresa Castracane)
“Well.” From Lisa Kron (“Fun Home,” due shortly at the National Theatre), an autobiographical play dealing with her mother. “Director Michael Bloom’s beautifully paced production has a warm, funny anchor in Audrey Bertaux’s now-poised, now-rattled Lisa. Elizabeth Pierotti’s affably batty Ann generates hilarious and touching moments. That’s particularly true when Ann unintentionally sabotages her daughter’s memory-play plans, luring the ensemble away from their assigned roles as figures from the past.” (Celia Wren) Through April 23 at 1st Stage, 1524 Spring Hill Rd., McLean. Tickets $15-$30. Call 703-854-1856 or visit 1ststagetysons.org.
“What Every Girl Should Know.” Part of Forum Theatre’s “Nasty Women Rep” with “Dry Land.” “Arresting and appealingly idiosyncratic. Set in 1914 and directed by Jenna Duncan, the play chronicles the friendship of four girls at a reformatory school in New York. Joan (Lida Maria Benson), Anne (Menendez), Lucy (Rich) and Theresa (Whitworth) have rich fantasy lives; they are also fascinated by the idea of Margaret Sanger, the crusader for women’s right to birth control. (Sanger founded what became Planned Parenthood.) The fact that Sanger’s work is at odds with the law only increases her appeal in the eyes of the four friends, who have good reason to be rebellious.” (Celia Wren) Through April 15 at the Silver Spring Black Box Theater, 8641 Colesville Rd. Tickets $18-$38. Call (301) 588-8279 or visit forum-theatre.org
CLOSING
“Marx in Soho.” The small female-centric troupe Nu Sass Productions presents historian Howard Zinn’s solo play. “Marx is played by Mary Myers, who thoroughly convinces you that she knows each historical twist and theoretical turn in this monologue. It undervalues Myers to say she commands the living-room-size Caos on F, with seating for 30. Yet command it she does, roving the space as her Marx recalls writing ‘Das Kapital’ while observing the rising rift between workers and industrialists in London’s Soho district. Myers looks you in the eye and expects answers whenever she asks questions. Her lively give-and-take brings wit and personality to what could be a highly wonky talk.” (Nelson Pressley) Through April 2 at Caos on F, 923 F St. NW. Tickets $30. Call 315-783-6650 or visit nusass.com.
Mary Myers as Karl Marx in Howard Zinn’s "Marx in Soho.” (Tori Boutin )
“The Select (The Sun Also Rises).” “Hemingway lovers will find much to savor in this inventive account of ‘The Sun Also Rises,’ which uses the author’s words exclusively, edited down to 3 hours 15 minutes of exposition. The early sequences of the production, brought to Shakespeare Theatre Company’s Lansburgh Theatre by New York-based Elevator Repair Service, are a bit slow going: As with many a novel, you have to be willing to stick with it. On Monday night, a sizable chunk of the audience lost patience and left at intermission. Which is a shame, because those who stayed were immersed ever more compellingly in the troupe’s stagecraft, an enjoyable grab bag of sound effects and other imaginative narrative devices, orchestrated by director John Collins.” (Peter Marks) Through April 2 at the Lansburgh Theatre, 450 Seventh St. NW. Tickets $44-$118. Call 202-547-1122 or visit shakespearetheatre.org .
TYA (Theater for Young Audiences
ETC.
“The Accidental Hero.” Patrick Dewane’s true story of his grandfather liberating a Czech village in World War II. April 2 at Ford’s Theatre, 511 10th St. NW. Tickets free, reservations recommended. Call 202-347-4833 or visit fords.org.
Director Peter Brook’s "Battlefield," touring at the Kennedy Center. (Pascal Victor)
“Battlefield.” “Thirty-two years ago, Peter Brook first staged his nine-hour adaptation of ‘The Mahabharata,’ reputedly the longest poem ever written. Derived from that play by Jean-Claude Carrière, Brook and co-director Marie-Hélène Estienne briskly recount in this compressed treatment the experiences of a reluctant Indian king, Yudhishthira, in the aftermath of a calamitous battle that has resulted in hideous carnage . . . You’ll be astonished by how richly the stories related by the various teachers, relatives and deities apply to the modern day.” (Peter Marks) Through April 2 in the Family Theater. Tickets $35. Call 202-467-4600 or visit kennedy-center.org.
The Capitol Steps. The longtime political satirists, tearing laughs from the headlines. Fridays and Saturdays in the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center Amphitheater, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave. NW. Tickets $40.50. Call 202-397-7328 or visit www.capsteps.com.
“Shear Madness.” The indestructible interactive comedy whodunit, at 12,000-plus performances. Ongoing in the Kennedy Center’s Theater Lab. Tickets $50-$54. Call 202-467-4600 or visit kennedy-center.org.
“The Trojan War: Our Warrior Chorus.” U.S. combat veterans of The Warrior Chorus perform with actors from the New York-based touring Aqulia Theatre in this multimedia event that includes classic texts; on a brief national tour before playing the Brooklyn Academy of Music later in April. April 1 at the Alden, 1234 Ingleside Avenue, McLean, VA. Tickets $35. Call 703-790-0123 or visit aldentheatre.org
