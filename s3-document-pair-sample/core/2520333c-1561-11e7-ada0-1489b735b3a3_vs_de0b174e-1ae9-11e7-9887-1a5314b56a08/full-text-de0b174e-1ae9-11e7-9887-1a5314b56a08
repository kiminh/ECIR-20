DC Theater Friday: Shows bloom in twos
Theater & Dance

R&B singer Brandy Norwood parachutes into the Kennedy Center as Roxie Hart in the touring “Chicago.” (Jeremy Daniel)
The weekly feature of what’s happening on Washington stages.
The Chekhov double bill is a must for die-hard theater buffs: Jackson Gay’s staging of “Three Sisters” is exactingly calibrated with Aaron Posner’s bracing new “No Sisters,” running upstairs and with much of the same cast at precisely the same time. An appetite for twin pairings can also be satisfied by Forum Theatre’s “Nasty Women” rep, Mosaic Theater Company’s “South Africa: Then and Now” rep and Brave Spirits’ classical “Incest Rep.” Staging a single show: so passé . . .
Already looking ahead? Keep up with the latest, most comprehensive guide to D.C. theater’s 2017-18 season here, with notes from Post critics. More than 100 shows are already announced.

CONTINUING
Nathan Hinton and Tom Story in Athol Fugard’s "Blood Knot" at Mosaic Theater Company of DC. (Stan Barouh)
“Back to Methuselah.” From the Shavian specialists at the Washington Stage Guild, the final third of George Bernard Shaw’s epic-length futuristic saga, following Part 1 in 2014 and Part 2 in 2015. “If this now feels like inside baseball for hardcore followers of George Bernard Shaw, that was always to be expected. The five-part play — split into thirds by the Stage Guild — about dumb humankind trying to grow up is unnervingly long and unapologetically intellectual . . . A generally static yet smartly acted show, directed by Bill Largess with a keen ear for the thrust of Shavian arguments.” (Nelson Pressley) Through April 16 at the Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church, 900 Massachusetts Ave. NW. Tickets $25-$60. Call 202-347-9620 or visit stageguild.org
“The Blood Knot.” “Mosaic typically leans hard (and thoughtfully) into new works on contested issues, but this one has a deeper pedigree. It’s an acclaimed 1961 work by South Africa’s great anti-apartheid playwright Athol Fugard. And it’s directed by Joy Zinoman, the retired founding artistic director of the Studio Theatre. ‘Blood Knot’ deals with half brothers Morris, who is light enough to pass as white, and Zachariah, who is dark-skinned . . . Cannily winds itself up to epic heights thanks to the earthy, ferocious performances by Tom Story and Nathan Hinton.” (Nelson Pressley) P art of Mosaic’s “South Africa: Then and Now” rep with Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela’s “A Human Being Died That Night.” Through April 30 at the Atlas Performing Arts Center, 1333 H St. NE., Tickets $20-$60. Call 202-399-7993 or visit mosaictheater.org
“Chicago.” Brandy Norwood plays Roxie opposite Terra C. MacLeod’s Velma in the Broadway hit’s first ever run at the Kennedy Center. “If you’ve seen the show half a dozen times, this iteration will fall in the middle of the pack . . . What Brandy Norwood brings is her smoky, singular, Grammy-winning voice. You’d take her sultry, dead-accurate crooning over plastic Broadway belting any day; that’s the asset. She moves better than you’d expect during her long fantasia about fame, the slow-vamping ‘Roxie,’ and she can be funny (as long as she keeps her speaking energy up), unleashing a deliriously skillful string of notes as a witty, lusty response to one of the muscled chorus boys sidling her way. The dance-driven ironic happy ending? Not her strong point.” (Nelson Pressley) Through April 16 in the Kennedy Center’s Opera House. Tickets $49-$149. Call 202-467-4600 or visit kennedy-center.org
“Dry Land.” A drama about two teen girls — one of them with an unwanted pregnancy — by young writer Ruby Rae Spiegel; part of Forum Theatre’s “Nasty Women Rep” with “What Every Girl Should Know.” A “heartbreaking and often funny play, artfully directed by Amber Paige McGinnis . . . Though it barely strays from its main locker-room setting, the play offers vivid glimpses of the society that has left Amy and Ester feeling uncertain, vulnerable, rushed and judged, but neither hopeless nor helpless.” (Celia Wren) Through April 15 at the Silver Spring Black Box Theater, 8641 Colesville Rd. Tickets $18-$38. Call (301) 588-8279 or visit forum-theatre.org.
“A King and No King.” “Brave Spirits Theatre’s revival of a 1611 tragicomedy by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher chronicles the scandalous love between Arbaces, king of Iberia (Brendan Edward Kennedy), and his sister Princess Panthea (Kathryn Zoerb). As if the siblings’ romance weren’t complicated enough, the moody Arbaces has promised Panthea to his recently vanquished enemy, Tigranes, king of Armenia (Gary DuBreuil), who is loath to give up his own sweetheart, Spaconia (Alison Talvacchio). On a stark, runway-style stage, dressed in modern-meets-Renaissance garb (the aesthetic for both productions), the actors conjure up the scenes of scheming, recrimination and braggadocio that hurtle into a happy ending.” (Celia Wren) Part of Brave Spirits’ “Incest Rep” with “’Tis Pity She’s a Whore.” Through April 23 at the Lab at Convergence, 1819 N. Quaker Lane, Alexandria. Tickets $20, or see both shows for $30. Call 240-516-8745 or visit bravespiritstheatre.com
“King Lear.” Lean & Hungry Theatre typically produces audio versions of plays, and the radio technique hampers the “fully staged” venture in a small black box at the Atlas Performing Arts Center. The show never achieves its own visual language, despite fog, low lights, modern costumes and the persistent musical underscoring that is jarringly generic: it makes Shakespeare sound like a soap opera. That heaps a lot of pressure on the actors, and very few performers really come through in this sizable tragedy. Bill Grimmette is a promising but uncertain Lear, but Jessica Lefkow and Duyen Washington are expert as Kent and Goneril. Far too much of the rest of this is underimagined cartoon villiany. (Nelson Pressley) Through April 23 at Atlas Performing Arts Center, 1333 H St. NE. Tickets $20. Call 202-399-7993 or visit leanandhungrytheater.com
“Midwestern Gothic.” A brand new musical thriller set in a small town, with music by Josh Schmidt (composer of “The Adding Machine”) and book by the busy librettist Royce Vavrek. “It isn’t quite ‘Fargo, the Musical,’ but ‘Midwestern Gothic’ attempts to dance right up to the edge of Coen brothers territory, with maybe a quick two-step and a hop over to the land of David Lynch . . . What we’re to make of the manipulative Stina — who ropes into her odd, malevolent schemes a local boob — is never brought entertainingly to light. An audience begins to lose hope, and interest, well before the bloodiest business has a chance to start.” (Peter Marks) Through April 30 at Signature Theatre, 4200 Campbell Ave., Arlington. Tickets $40-$100. Call 703-820-9771 or visit sigtheatre.org.
Jackson Gay’s staging of Anton Chekhov’s "Three Sisters," part of an ingenious rep at the Studio Theatre with Aaron Posner’s modern riff “No Sisters.” Both are performed simultaneously, with certain cast members dashing up and down the backstage stairs during the shows. (Teresa Wood)
“No Sisters.” Aaron Posner (“Stupid F-ing Bird,” “Life Sucks”) continues his string of free-spirited Chekhov adaptations. “It’s a clever, cerebral theater game that playwright-director Posner constructs — especially since simultaneously, in another theater downstairs, a production of the actual ‘Three Sisters’ is going on. This requires those seven actors (and an eighth), to commute between the two shows, repeatedly entering in ‘No Sisters’ after points at which they exit from ‘Three Sisters.’ You got that? The complicated logistics make it reverential fun: six television monitors are perched on the ‘No Sisters’ stage so that we can see ‘Three Sisters’ unfolding and they can tell when it’s their cues.” (Peter Marks) Through April 23 at Studio Theatre, 1501 14th St. NW. Tickets $20-$80. Call 202-332-3300 or visit studiotheatre.org.
“Parade.” Fascinating to see this Jason Robert Brown-Alfred Uhry musical — fleeting on Broadway in 1998-99, and staged by Ford’s Theatre in 2011 — open at the same time as Ford’s lavish “Ragtime.” The heavy thematic lift of “Parade,” about the 1913 anti-Semitic lynching of Leo Frank in Georgia, is less durable than the comparably serious, comparably epic “Ragtime” (so many righteous anthems!): the crime is outrageous, but the red-faced mob is brutish and the racist railroading is rote. The songs labor to rouse indignation, but the effort doesn’t pay — and Keegan’s earnest low-budget staging, featuring little more than broad swatches of bland light, lacks style. Nice to hear a nearly 10 peiece orchestra playing the robust score, though, and the two leads — Michael Innocenti as a flinty Frank and Eleanor J. Todd as his wife — are terrific. (Nelson Pressley) April 15 at Keegan Theater, 1742 Church Street NW. Tickets $45-$55. Call 202-265-3767 or visit keegantheatre.com
Writer-performer Nilaja Sun in "Pike St." at Woolly Mammoth. (Teresa Castracane)
“Pike Street.” “Anyone who saw Sun’s breathtakingly smart and entertaining ‘No Child . . .’ — in which she played teacher and students in a harried New York public school — won’t be surprised and will be equally rewarded by another 90 minutes in this artist’s graceful company. The setting this time is Pike Street on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, where Puerto Rican immigrants are bracing for a storm that puts you in mind of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 . . . As Sun pursues each highly idiosyncratic character, she keeps you off balance about where the family has been and where the story is going. It turns out to be a resonant, highly timely American immigrant tale.” (Nelson Pressley) Through April 23 at Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, 641 D St. NW. Tickets $20-$93. Call 202-393-3939 or visit woollymammoth.net
“Ragtime.” “‘Make them hear you,’ goes the climactic chorus in the musical ‘Ragtime,’ and the new production at Ford’s Theatre stirringly delivers on the kaleidoscopic show’s cries for justice. The setting is 1906, but the issues ring true throughout the 1998 musical’s crusading score . . . As its cast of two dozen swarms up and down a three-story set layered with class implications, Peter Flynn’s production utilizes the full volume of the large Ford’s stage. Ford’s keeps displaying a knack for putting local actors into the right big roles, and as a composed, powerful Coalhouse, McAllister emerges as the soul of the show.” (Nelson Pressley) Through May 20 at Ford’s Theatre, 511 10th St. NW. Tickets $18-$71. Call 202-347-4833 or visit fords.org.
“A Raisin in the Sun.” Arena Stage tackles Lorraine Hansberry’s 1959 drama for the first time. Through May 7 at Arena Stage, 1101 Sixth St. SW. Tickets $40-$111, subject to change. Call 202-488-3300 or visit arenastage.org
“Three Sisters.” Anton Chekhov’s play directed by Jackson Gay, sharing a cast and running simultaneously with Aaron Posner’s new “No Sisters.” “Not only drags, it’s also a bit of a lightweight drag. Our encounter with the passive, aristocratic sisters and their stultifying existences has to live in an air of compelling distress. ‘It’s hard to say what is “off” about them,’ Anﬁsa the maid, played expertly by Nancy Robinette, rightly observes in ‘No Sisters.’ Which means that if the ennui and melancholy of Olga (Bridget Flanery), Masha (Caroline Hewitt) and Irina (Emilie Krause) are not leavened by some bittersweet sense of complexity and mystery, there is nothing much to savor.” (Peter Marks) Through April 23 at Studio Theatre, 1501 14th St. NW. Tickets $20-$80. Call 202-332-3300 or visit studiotheatre.org.
“’Tis Pity She’s a Whore.” John Ford’s 17th century tragedy of jealousy, part of Brave Spirits Theatre’s “Incest Rep” with “A King and No King.” “Director Charlene V. Smith (Brave Spirits’ artistic director) nicely hones the comedy in a subplot about a ninny named Bergetto, who in this production is seen sucking on a series of lollipops. The drollery serves to emphasize the intensity of the broader play, which centers on a secret love affair between siblings Giovanni and Annabella . . . The acting in the productions can be creaky, and the fights often look fake, but it’s mostly fun to watch these 400-year-old soap operas rip along.” (Celia Wren) Through April 23 at the Lab at Convergence, 1819 N. Quaker Lane, Alexandria. Tickets $20, or see both shows for $30. Call 240-516-8745 or visit bravespiritstheatre.com
“Well.” From Lisa Kron (“Fun Home,” due shortly at the National Theatre), an autobiographical play dealing with her mother. “Director Michael Bloom’s beautifully paced production has a warm, funny anchor in Audrey Bertaux’s now-poised, now-rattled Lisa. Elizabeth Pierotti’s affably batty Ann generates hilarious and touching moments. That’s particularly true when Ann unintentionally sabotages her daughter’s memory-play plans, luring the ensemble away from their assigned roles as figures from the past.” (Celia Wren) Through April 23 at 1st Stage, 1524 Spring Hill Rd., McLean. Tickets $15-$30. Call 703-854-1856 or visit 1ststagetysons.org.
Yakima Rich and Emily Whitworth in Monica Byrne’s "What Every Girl Should Know" at Forum Theatre, part of the “Nasty Women” rep with “Dry Land.” (DJ Corey Photography)
“What Every Girl Should Know.” Part of Forum Theatre’s “Nasty Women Rep” with “Dry Land.” “Arresting and appealingly idiosyncratic. Set in 1914 and directed by Jenna Duncan, the play chronicles the friendship of four girls at a reformatory school in New York. Joan (Lida Maria Benson), Anne (Menendez), Lucy (Rich) and Theresa (Whitworth) have rich fantasy lives; they are also fascinated by the idea of Margaret Sanger, the crusader for women’s right to birth control. (Sanger founded what became Planned Parenthood.) The fact that Sanger’s work is at odds with the law only increases her appeal in the eyes of the four friends, who have good reason to be rebellious.” (Celia Wren) Through April 15 at the Silver Spring Black Box Theater, 8641 Colesville Rd. Tickets $18-$38. Call (301) 588-8279 or visit forum-theatre.org
CLOSING
“Intelligence.” Arena Stage takes on the Valerie Plame affair in this premiere by Jacqueline E. Lawton. “That ‘Intelligence’ seeks with the dignified stoicism of Greek drama to recount some key American policy failures — and also the betrayal of Plame by her employers — is a mark in its favor. Still, the 90-minute piece never develops any galvanizing momentum or a thesis that helps us understand what about the Plame affair requires this particular treatment. As a result, ‘Intelligence’ proves of little more use in learning about the case than consulting Wikipedia.” (Peter Marks) Through April 9 at Arena Stage, 1101 Sixth St. SW. Tickets $90-$110. Call 202-488-3300 or visit arenastage.org.
“Mnemonic.” Theater Alliance creates its own staging of the 1999 devised piece by London’s Complicite. “Although memory is a major motif in ‘Mnemonic,’ as the title suggests, the play is concerned more broadly with efforts to ferret out the past. Because the past in ‘Mnemonic’ brims with tales of people crossing borders, the play implicitly counters the isolationist and nationalist sentiment that’s widespread in today’s world. Nevertheless, it’s hard to connect emotionally . . . The very competent performances and the serviceable stage pictures never allow the potential poetry to achieve liftoff.” (Celia Wren) Through April 9 at the Anacostia Playhouse, 2020 Shannon Pl. SE. Tickets $30-$40. Call 202-290-2328 or visit theateralliance.com.

“The Night Alive.” Somehow an irresistable script: Irish playwright Conor McPherson’s popular drama of a down-and-outer who takes in a battered woman gets its third D.C. area staging in two seasons, this time from Scena Theatre. It’s a lovely play, and the key to this performance is Barry McAvoy’s quiet turn as Tommy, the man on the skids. McAvoy’s almost too hangdog and reticent in the early going, but when the character finds his spine he feels terrifically true. He’s a good fit for Robert McNamara’s intimate staging at the Atlas Performing Arts Center, even though there’s a danger and a warm glow to McPherson’s tale that this earnest, rather blunt performance doesn’t fully capture. (Nelson Pressley) Through April 9 at the Atlas Performing Arts Center, 1333 H St. NE. Tickets $20-$40. Call 202-399-7993 or visit scenatheatre.org.
“Suffrage Plays.” Short Edwardian plays connected to the suffrage movement. “Rough-hewed but interesting . . . There’s a timeliness in these plays, which were written between 1908 and 1914 as ‘unapologetic propaganda pieces,’ as ‘The Methuen Drama Book of Suffrage Plays’ (this show’s source book) puts it. The fervor behind the scripts seems to echo the fervor that has prompted some contemporary feminists to embrace the term ‘nasty women.’” (Celia Wren) Through April 9 at Venus Theater, 21 C St., Laurel. Tickets $20-$40. Call 866-811-4111 or visit venustheatre.org
