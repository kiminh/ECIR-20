bacteria get danger weird space your health astronaut sandra magnu run salmonella experi board final space shuttl mission st 135 courtesi nasa 2006 cheryl nickerson sent cultur salmonella bacteria ride space shuttl atlanti eleven dai later she watch anxious from kennedi space center dead night her bacteria return safe nickerson microbiologist arizona state univers her team infect hundr mice salmonella grown space same time infect hundr other mice salmonella simultan grown ground had work quickli befor bacteria lost effect space took them about three hour from time shuttl land you get on chanc get right nickerson said we move lightn fast after few dai more mice space grown salmonella were get sick normal salmonella can kill mous about seven dai mice given space salmonella start die two dai earlier lower dose than normal first time someon had definit show bacteria becam more danger after spaceflight ha been known decad someth happen microb leav planet earth sometim grow faster get better caus diseas just often do opposit slow down becom less harm biggest risk expert sai behavior unpredict when you send peopl space peopl who teem microb there’ littl room surpris bacteria were some first life form sent space 1960 russian satellit brought e coli aerobact aerogen staphylococcu orbit conclud those organ could live micrograv over next 50 year nasa other spaceflight program discov onli could bacteria surviv sometim thrive 1967 nasa launch biosatellit ii strain e coli salmonella typhimurium board found cell cultur orbit grew twice much those grown ground 1982 e coli soviet salyut 7 space station increas it resist two type antibiot colistin kanamycin staph aureu increas resist other antibiot oxacillin chloramphenicol erythromycin result were inconsist bacteria call bacillu subtili cultur onboard apollo 16 17 develop normal spore same bacteria spollo soyuz test project 1978 decreas spore format research chang nutrient bacteria were grown result would complet differ 2011 mark ott microbiologist nasa’ johnson space center found staph aureu grown bioreactor simul zero graviti appear less virul though increas product biofilm sticki clump bacteria want colon live harmoni rather than becom pathogen he said respons vari from pathogen pathogen ott’ job keep astronaut safe from infect from health care perspect it’ littl nerv rack he said i want abl gener about bacteria i want abl sai what’ caus how we make sure doesn’t happen micrograv danger environ astronaut can suffer loss bone densiti radiat poison degrad vision mani research now sai micrograv isn’t what chang bacteria least directli nickerson theoriz forc call fluid shear can explain mani odd chang bodi bacteria alwai interact liquid like blood mucou stomach fluid fluid appli physic forc shear bacteria’ outer membran like forc water rush over rock bottom riverb nickerson think bacteria feel shear from surround us clue how should behav micrograv happen ultim low shear environ peopl have vari level fluid shear differ part bodi interestingli place low fluid shear includ intestin tract respiratori area urogenit area nickerson think it’ coincid all three common site infect bacteria sens those shear level reprogram itself do what need do surviv those condit nickerson said david klau aerospac engin univers colorado boulder ha been studi relationship between graviti bacteria 25 year he said fluid shear could also help explain increas antibiot resist space cultur physic trigger alter chemic environ around cell klau said alter environ around cell chang biolog respons there’ black magic sinc 2006 nickerson ha complet five bacteria experi space she just got fund two more her bioreactor earth which creat low fluid shear condit nickerson ha also been abl replic mani her result she ha identifi on protein hfq regul which gene activ bacteria she think mai respond chang shear other work how micrograv might disrupt entri nutrient bacteria space radiat doesn’t seem factor would caus mutat which nickerson hasn’t seen yet her flight sampl good new so far radiat space creat super bug nickerson ha onli studi effect short term flight her next project look longer durat it’ import understand how bacteria might chang over greater period time nasa send human mar 2030 sai plan do so bacteria go them astronaut themselv human walk ferment said kasthuri venkateswaran astrobiologist nasa’ jet propuls laboratori peopl share bodi trillion bacteria they’r crucial normal health function nickerson ott other work show bacteria can behav differ when physic surround chang could possibl bacteria astronaut bring them space affect hernan lorenzi research j craig venter institut ha been studi veri problem past four year he ha collect sampl from nine astronaut befor dure after long durat mission he look microbiom nose mouth skin gut see what happen after spaceflight he expect decreas each area sinc environ so steril nose he right gut sever strain bacteria prolifer other decreas it’ unclear what would mean human health sever bacteria chang help prime immun system it’ also been well document immun system compromis space lorenzi worri astronaut more vulner diseas imagin situat where on astronaut get infect bacteria you carri your gut regularli becom pathogen becaus some factor due space he said usual recommend therapi you take antibiot fight bacteria when you do you would kill most your bacteria how you go recov microbiom onc you elimin most bacteria you had gut nickerson most tantal thing about all research actual ha littl do space trip mar see how bacteria fungi virus respond micrograv mai learn new wai combat them earth my endgam nickerson said i think space flight revolutionari approach understand how biolog system oper when you studi bacteria under extrem environ you realli see how they’r go adapt surviv potenti enorm earth base infecti diseas research rare pai attent physic forc bacteria nickerson said even though could plai role how pathogen caus diseas bacteria like all biolog be evolv live graviti it’ been on few constant sinc emerg billion year ago remov some interest thing bound happen bacteria most adapt most chang most divers group live organ we have she said you hit them some stress they’r go chang like correct articl origin call bacillu subtili fungu type bacteria read more nasa' 1976 vike mission mar did everyth suppos do except find martian pluto get buddi new dwarf planet discov our solar system nasa spot seemingli imposs cloud titan second time
