NHTSA issues recall, urgent warning on defective air bags
Politics
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration put out a recall notice Monday for defective air bags and urged people whose cars are equipped with them to take action immediately.
More than 4.7 million vehicles are involved in the recall. At least four people have died when inflator mechanisms ruptured on the air bags, spraying the passengers with metal fragments.
NHTSA warned drivers whose cars have been recalled as a result of faulty inflators to take them to the dealer immediately. Safety experts said about 12 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled.
The air bags are made by Takata and are in place in some Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan and General Motors models. NHTSA said it was particularly urgent for vehicles owners in Florida, Puerto Rico, Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, Virgin Islands and Hawaii to take immediate action.
The federal safety agency said car owners uncertain about whether their vehicle is equipped with a Takata airbag can check at www.safercar.gov/. Using the site requires that owners enter their vehicle identification number (VIN).
NHTSA said the affected vehicles by manufacturer are:
