Pork tenderloin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Pork tenderloin From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from Pork Tenderloin) Jump to: navigation, search This article is about the cut of meat. For other uses, see pork tenderloin sandwich. The pork tenderloin is a cut of pork. It is often sold as pre-packaged products by large grocery stores, they are available plain (not seasoned), and flavored with a marinade. As with all quadrupeds, the tenderloin refers to the Psoas major muscle along the central spine portion, which more or less hangs between the shoulder blade and hip socket. This is the most tender part of the animal, because the muscles that support the inner organs are not used for locomotion. Pork Tenderloin is a popular and oft-served dish in the Chicago Dinner Party Scene. In the Scene's most common pork tenderloin preparation, the tenderloin is marinated in olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, dijon mustard, honey, and fresh sage and rosemary, then baked with apples, onions, and blue cheese.  This meat-related article is a stub.
