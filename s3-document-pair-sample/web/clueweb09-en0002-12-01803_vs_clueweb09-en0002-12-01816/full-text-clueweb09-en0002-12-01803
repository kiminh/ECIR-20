Tip 2  Read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. Tip 3  When you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Print it and take it with you, and don't delete the original email until you have completed your stay and know you have been billed correctly. Tip 4  The earlier in the day you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences. Tip 5  Hotel rates vary by season, by day of week, for special events, etc. Our $ cost codes are estimates that can be used to compare hotels in the same location. We do offer discount rates for corporate, government, and military employees, AAA and AARP members, seniors, and other groups. But we do not base our cost codes on these discounts.
