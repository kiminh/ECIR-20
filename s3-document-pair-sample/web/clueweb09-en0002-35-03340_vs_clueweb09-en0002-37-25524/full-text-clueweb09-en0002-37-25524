In fact, we were founded in 1976 on an innovative idea: make higher education highly accessible for working students. Still guided by this idea, University of Phoenix has helped transform the landscape of higher education in widely recognized ways. Many of the conveniences that 21st-century students now take for grantedevening classes, flexible scheduling, continuous enrollment, a student-centered environment, practitioner faculty, online classes, online library, ebooks, computer simulationswere pioneered or made acceptable through University of Phoenix's efforts. Not surprisingly, our unique approach has helped us grow from our humble origins as an upstart institution serving the unrecognized needs of working students. Today, University of Phoenix is the largest private university in North America, with nearly 200 convenient locations, as well as Internet delivery in most countries around the world. We're also a comprehensive university. University of Phoenix has more than 100 degree programs at the associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels in much-desired employment areas, from business and technology to health care and education. Most importantly, we're constantly innovating to help students balance education and life in a rapidly changing world.
