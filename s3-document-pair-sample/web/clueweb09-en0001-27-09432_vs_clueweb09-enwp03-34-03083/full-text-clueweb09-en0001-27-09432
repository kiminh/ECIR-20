Primarily the band consisted of John Lennon (rhythm guitar, vocals), Paul McCartney (bass guitar, vocals), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals) and Ringo Starr (drums, vocals). The Beatles are recognised for leading the mid-1960s musical "British Invasion" into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored genres ranging from Tin Pan Alley to psychedelic rock. Their clothes, styles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon solo careers. The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the history of popular music, selling over one billion records internationally.[1] In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different singles, albums, and EPs that reached number one, earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company, EMI, estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide.[2] According to the Recording Industry Association of America, The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band.[3] In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[4] According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008, Billboard magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles reached #1 again.[5] Contents 1 History 1.1 195760: Formation 1.2 196062: Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein 1.3 1962: Record contract 1.4 196263: Fame in the UK 1.5 196364: American success 1.6 196466: Beatlemania crosses the Atlantic 1.7 1966: Backlash and controversy 1.8 196669: Studio years 1.9 196970: Let It Be project and breakup 1.10 19701993: Post-breakup 1.11 19941996: Reunion and Anthology 1.12 1996present: Recent projects and developments 2 Musical evolution 3 Films 4 Legacy 4.1 Radio 4.2 Recreational drug use 5 Discography 5.1 Song catalogue 5.2 Studio albums 5.3 CD releases 5.4 2009 CD remasters 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References 9 Further reading 10 External links History Main article: History of The Beatles 195760: Formation Main article: The Quarrymen In March 1957 John Lennon formed a skiffle group called The Quarrymen.[6] Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later.[7] On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group.[8] Harrison joined the Quarrymen as lead guitarist after a rehearsal in March 1958.[9][10] Lennon and McCartney both played rhythm guitar during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer Colin Hanton left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend Stuart Sutcliffe joined on bass in January 1960.[11][12] The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including "Johnny and the Moondogs" and "Long John and The Beatles". Sutcliffe suggested the name "The Beetles" as a tribute to Buddy Holly and The Crickets. After a tour in Scotland, the band changed their name to "The Beatles". In May 1960, the then Silver Beetles toured northeast Scotland as a back-up band with Johnny Gentle.[11] For the tour, the group secured the services of Tommy Moore, who was considerably older than the others.[13] Moore left the band soon after the tour.[14] His departure posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager, Allan Williams, had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the Reeperbahn in Hamburg, West Germany.[15] 196062: Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein The group invited Pete Best to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. Best had played with The Blackjacks in The Casbah Coffee Club, owned by his mother, Mona Best.[16] Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began playing in Hamburg at the Indra Club and moved to the Kaiserkeller in October 1960. On 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age.[17] A week later, having started a small fire at their living quarters while vacating it for more luxurious rooms, McCartney and Best were arrested for arson and deported.[18] Lennon followed the others to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fianc�e Astrid Kirchherr. The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with Chas Newby substituting for Sutcliffe.[19] The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007. The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the "Top Ten Club". They were recruited by singer Tony Sheridan to act as his backing band on a series of recordings for the German Polydor Records label,[20] produced by famed bandleader Bert Kaempfert.[21] Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "My Bonnie (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)", which appeared on the German charts.[22] A few copies were also pressed under the Decca label for United States disc jockeys.[23] When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr.[24] McCartney took over bass duties.[25] The band returned to Liverpool from Germany, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at The Cavern Club. From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963.[26] On 9 November 1961, Brian Epstein, owner of the North End Music Store (NEMS) on Great Charlotte Street, saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. Epstein became aware of the group after he received requests for the Sheridan/Beatles recording of "My Bonnie." In a meeting with the group on 10 December 1961, Brian Epstein proposed the idea of managing the group.[27] The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Epstein on 24 January 1962.[28] He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records A&R executive Dick Rowe turned Epstein down flat, informing him that "guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."[29] (See The Decca audition.) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached EMI marketing executive Ron White.[30] White contacted EMI producers Norrie Paramor, Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer  George Martin  who was on holiday at the time.[31] The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The Star Club.[32] Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a brain hemorrhage.[33] 1962: Record contract Epstein went to the HMV store on Oxford Street in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's Parlophone label on a one-year renewable contract.[34] Martin had a problem with Pete Best.[35] Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio.[36] In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962.[37] They asked Richard Starkey, known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg.[38] Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer Andy White for their next session on 11 September.[39] White's only released performances were recordings of "Love Me Do" and "P.S. I Love You", found on The Beatles' first album. The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit "Love Me Do", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen.[40] "Love Me Do" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964. 196263: Fame in the UK The "drop-T" logo On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "Please Please Me", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the NME chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled Please Please Me. The band's first televised performance was on the People and Places programme, transmitted live from Manchester by Granada Television on 17 October 1962.[41] As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "Beatlemania". The band also began to be noticed by serious music critics. In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the "drop-T" logo) made its debut. It was designed by London drum dealer Ivor Arbiter.[42][43] 196364: American success EMI's American operation, Capitol Records, declined to issue the singles "Please Please Me" and "From Me to You".[44] Vee-Jay Records issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of WLS, placed "Please Please Me" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties.[45] In August 1963, Swan Records released "She Loves You", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on Dick Clark's TV show American Bandstand produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's distinctive hairstyles.[46] In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded Ed Sullivan to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "I Want to Hold Your Hand".[47] On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the CBS Evening News. The segment first aired on the CBS Morning News on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of John F. Kennedy that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in Silver Spring, Maryland to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's WWDC radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single "I Want to Hold Your Hand" sent over to him in Washington DC. Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963.[48] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" Sample of "I Want to Hold Your Hand". Problems listening to this file? See media help. Several New York radio stations began playing "I Want to Hold Your Hand" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964, Cashbox magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January. It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising, and completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away. Seltaeb was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles merchandising rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees.[49] The Beatles as they arrive at JFK Airport, New York City on 7 February 1964 196466: Beatlemania crosses the Atlantic On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group.[50] They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including Maureen Cleave), and Phil Spector, who had booked himself on the same flight.[51] When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed John F. Kennedy Airport, they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans.[52] After a press conference, The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: "[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."[53] After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 �F (39 �C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so Neil Aspinall replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.[54] The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show.[55] The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a "fad", and "could not carry a tune across the Atlantic".[56] The band's first American concert appearance was at Washington Coliseum in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964.[57] After The Beatles' success in 1964, Vee-Jay Records and Swan Records took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "My Bonnie" and "Ain't She Sweet", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to Introducing... The Beatles (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual LP called The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons. This 2-LP set paired Introducing... The Beatles and The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons, another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the Hear The Beatles Tell All album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled "Dave Hull interviews John Lennon", while side two was titled "Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo"). No beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim. The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release The Early Beatles, with three songs left off this final US version of the album. ("I Saw Her Standing There" was issued as the American B-side of "I Want to Hold Your Hand", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album meet the beatles. "Misery" and "There's a Place" were issued as a Capitol "Starline" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the Rarities compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged.[58] The Swan tracks "She Loves You" and "I'll Get You" were issued on the Capitol LP The Beatles' Second Album. Swan also issued the German-language version of "She Loves You", called "Sie Liebt Dich". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's Rarities album. In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer Jimmy Nicol. In Adelaide, The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at Adelaide Town Hall.[59] Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964.[60] On 6 June 1964, A Hard Day's Night, the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by Richard Lester, the film is a mockumentary of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential jukebox musicals.[61][62] That December the group released their fourth album, beatles for sale. In June 1965, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire, MBE. The band members were nominated by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who also was the M.P. for Huyton, Liverpool.[63] The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest.[64] In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film, Help!, was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album Help!, which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at Shea Stadium in New York to a crowd of 55,600.[65] On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a Bel Air mansion to meet Elvis Presley.[66] Biographer Peter Guralnick maintains that Presley was at best "lukewarm" about playing host to people he did not really know.[66] Paul McCartney later said: "It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."[67] Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: "'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."[68] The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session.[67] "They all went to the piano," says Lacker, "and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs, Chuck Berry songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "I Feel Fine", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"[68] Their sixth album, Rubber Soul, was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music.[69] "Help!"
