The State Fair, in turn, showcases agriculture and youth; educates the public about agriculture and our agricultural heritage; and entertains visitors with a variety of exhibits, events and performers. Through the annual State Fair and year-round business, we support family and youth-oriented activities and strive to be both a good community neighbor and corporate citizen.     Indiana State Fairgrounds :: 1202 E. 38th St. Indpls., IN 46205 :: 317/927-7500 fax: 317-927-7695
