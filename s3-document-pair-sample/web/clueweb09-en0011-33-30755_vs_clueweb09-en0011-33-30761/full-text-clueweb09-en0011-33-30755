Visitors should consider bringing their own beverages and some extra tea, coffee, and sugar that can be left behind as a small gift. You can't book these bungalows through an agent, you have to call them yourself or simply show up. You will pay the bungalow or guest house owner directly in Vatu. Air Vanuatu Tours will book your air tickets and provide the latest advice on the condition and probably occupancy of the village bungalows. Contact David Dick at Air Vanuatu Tours.
