(February 2009) Not to be confused with Mus��e des Beaux Arts (poem), the poem by W H Auden. ��cole Nationale Sup. des Beaux-Arts, Paris, Rue Bonaparte entrance ��cole des Beaux-Arts ("School of Fine Arts") refers to a number of influential art schools in France. The most famous is the ��cole Nationale Sup��rieure des Beaux-Arts, now located on the left bank in Paris, across the Seine from the Louvre, in the 6th arrondissement. The school has a history spanning more than 350 years, training many of the great artists in Europe. Beaux Arts style was modeled on classical "antiquities", preserving these idealized forms and passing the style on to future generations. [edit] History The origins of the school go back to 1648 when the "Acad��mie des Beaux-Arts" was founded by Cardinal Mazarin to educate the most talented students in drawing, painting, sculpture, engraving, architecture and other media. Louis XIV was known to select graduates from the school to decorate the royal apartments at Versailles, and in 1863 Napol��on III granted the school independence from the government, changing the name to "L���Ecole des Beaux-Arts". Women were admitted beginning in 1897. The curriculum was divided into the "Academy of Painting and Sculpture" and the "Academy of Architecture", but both programs focused on classical arts and architecture from Ancient Greek and Roman culture. All students were required to prove their skills with basic drawing tasks before advancing to figure drawing and painting. This culminated in a competition for the Grand Prix de Rome, awarding a full scholarship to study in Rome. The three trials to obtain the prize lasted for nearly three months [1]. Many of the most famous artists in Europe were trained here, to name but a few, they include G��ricault, Degas, Delacroix, Fragonard, Ingres, Monet, Moreau, Renoir, Seurat, Cassandre and Sisley. The buildings of the school are largely the creation of French architect Felix Duban, who undertook the main building in 1830, realigning the campus, and through 1861 completing an architectural program out towards the Quai Malaquias. The Paris school is the namesake and founding location of the Beaux Arts architectural movement in the early twentieth century. Known for demanding classwork and setting the highest standards for education, the ��cole attracted students from around the world ��� including the United States, where students returned to design buildings that would influence the history of architecture in America, including the Boston Public Library, 1888-1895 (McKim, Mead & White) and the New York Public Library, 1897-1911 (Carrere and Hastings). Architectural graduates, especially in France, are granted the title ��l��ve. The architecture department was separated from the ��cole after the May 1968 student strikes at the Sorbonne. The name was changed to ��cole Nationale Sup��rieure des Beaux-Arts, and now over 500 students make use of an extensive collection of classical art, with modern additions to the curriculum including photography and hypermedia.
