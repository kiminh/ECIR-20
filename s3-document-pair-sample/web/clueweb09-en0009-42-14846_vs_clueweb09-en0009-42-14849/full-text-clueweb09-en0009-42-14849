When Kiwi entrepreneur AJ Hackett developed the bungy jump, he based his idea on this fascinating ritual used by the men of Pentecost to celebrate the annual yam harvest. The ritual of the Ngol, or Nagol, has been practiced for many centuries on this remote and rugged island, and remains an integral part of village life. Every year when the yam crop emerges in early April, the villagers in the south begin building tall wooden towers ranging from 18m to 27m high. On chosen days�from April to early June, the men and boys make a spectacular leap from the towers with only elastic lianas (vines) to break their fall. Villagers believe this daredevil leap will ensure a bountiful yam harvest for the next year. The land diving ritual is said to have evolved from the story of a woman who spent many years trying to escape the unwanted attentions of her husband. Finally, in desperation, she climbed a tall banyan tree and threatened to leap to her death, daring her husband to follow her if his love was true. He leapt after her, plunging to his death  but his wily wife had tied vines to her ankles, attaching them to the tree to break her fall. These days, there are commercial land diving packages for visitors based at Bay Homo, with dives taking place on Saturdays throughout the yam season. A climber selects his own vines (one for each ankle) and its a fine art  if they are too long, he can crush his skull on the ground, and if they are not long enough, bones can be broken as he is jerked back into the tower. In the more traditional village of Bunlap, men still dive wearing a red nambas (penis sheath), while women dance below in grass skirts made from the fibres of the wild hibiscus (burao). Land Diving Packages Vanuatu Tourism can put you in touch with local tour operators. Day packages will include return airfares, return airport transfers at both ends (boat/truck), a picnic lunch, entrance fees to see the jump, a camera fee and the services of a guide. There are also multi-day packages which allow you to watch the final preparations of the tower platforms, and to join village celebrations following the jump. Prices range from about $34 (38,000 vatu) for a day trip, to about $55 (70,000 vatu) for a 3 day/2 night package. For specific details of land diving packages for 2008, visit Vanuatu Tourism Getting There Air Vanuatu Vanuatus main airline operates four domestic flights a week to the islands two airfields, departing from Port Vila (on Efate Island) and from Espiritu Santo.
