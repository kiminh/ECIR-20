The market place and Chinatown (behind main street) are good spots to look for bargains in brightly coloured sarongs, hand-printed shirts, fashion wear and souvenirs, but there is another side to shopping in Vanuatu that may surprise you. Port Vila�remains one of the last genuine duty free ports in the Pacific. Youre able to find fragrances, spirits and French champagnes, jewellery (especially Pacific black pearls), watches - including many Swiss brands, sunglasses and other fashion products you can find at home, most with savings of about 20-30% on the equivalent retail prices in Australia and New Zealand. The following Duty Free Stores belong to the Duty Free Traders Association. The main ones are listed�as well as�the import allowances on bringing your goods back home. As a traveller, you can purchase most goods duty free including larger electronic products (musical instruments and home theatre gear). You are not required to have your passport or ticket with you when you purchase, only your departure date and destination, and the DFTA shop will deliver the goods to the airport or main wharf in time for your departure  let them know if you change your flights!
