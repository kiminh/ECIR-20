Arkansas shares a border with six states, with its eastern border largely defined by the Mississippi River. Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozarks and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River. The capital and most populous city is Little Rock, located in the central portion of the state. With the exception of Hawaii, Arkansas is the smallest state entirely west of the Mississippi River. The Mississippi River forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in Clay and Greene counties where the St. Francis River forms the western boundary of the Missouri Bootheel, and in dozens of places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where it had last been legally specified. Arkansas shares its southern border with Louisiana, its northern border with Missouri, its eastern border with Tennessee and Mississippi, and its western border with Texas and Oklahoma. Arkansas is a land of mountains and valleys, thick forests and fertile plains. Northwest Arkansas is part of the Ozark Plateau including the Boston Mountains, to the south are the Ouachita Mountains and these regions are divided by the Arkansas River; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands. All of these mountains ranges are part of the U.S. Interior Highlands region, the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains. The highest point in the state is Mount Magazine in the Ouachita Mountains; it rises to 2,753 feet above sea level. More about Arkansas... Show new selections edit   Selected article The Gazette Building, located at 112 West Third street in Downtown Little Rock, Arkansas, was built in 1908 for the purpose of housing the Arkansas Gazette newspaper. The Gazette was the oldest newspaper west of the Mississippi River that had been published continuously by the same name until it was purchased in 1991 by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, its longtime rival. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 22, 1976. Although recognized as an architecturally significant structure, the primary significance of the Gazette Building lies in its representation of the Arkansas Gazette. (more...)

Shortly after he was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Hindman moved with his family to Jacksonville, Alabama and later Ripley, Mississippi. After receiving his primary education in Ripley, he attended the Lawrenceville Classical Institute (now known as the Lawrenceville School) and graduated with honors on September 25, 1843. Afterwards, he raised a company in Tippah County for the 2nd Mississippi regiment in the Mexican-American War. Hindman served during the war as a lieutenant and later as a captain of his company. After the war, he returned to Ripley. He studied law, and was admitted to the state bar in 1851. He then started a law practice in Ripley, before moving it to Helena two years later. Hindman then served as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1854 to 1856. He was elected as the Democratic representative from Arkansas's 1st congressional district in the Thirty-sixth Congress from March 4, 1859 to March 4, 1861. He was re-elected to the Thirty-seventh Congress, but declined to serve after the onset of the Civil War and Arkansas's secession from the Union. Instead, Hindman joined the armed forces of the Confederacy. He commanded the Trans-Mississippi Department, and later raised and commanded "Hindman's legion" for the Confederate States Army. He was promoted to brigadier general on September 28, 1861 and later to Major General on April 18, 1862. After the war, Hindman avoided surrender to the federal government by fleeing to Mexico City. He worked in Mexico as a coffee planter, and attempted to practice law. After the execution of Maximilian I of Mexico, Hindman submitted a petition for a pardon to President Andrew Johnson, but it was denied. Hindman, nonetheless, returned back to his former life in Helena. He became the leader of the "Young Democracy", a new political organization that was willing to accept the Reconstruction for the restoration of the Union. Unexpectedly, he was assassinated by an unknown individual on September 27, 1868 at his Helena home. (more ...)

According to 2005 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city was 10,467. The city is the county seat of Hempstead County. It is notable primarily as the birthplace of the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton (see Bill Clinton Birthplace). At the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Clinton ended his acceptance speech by saying, "I still believe in a place called Hope" The city tagged this statement as their unofficial motto. The city converted its railroad depot to a museum featuring the life and accomplishments of President Clinton. Hope is also the birthplace of the former governor of Arkansas and former 2008 Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee; former White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty; attorney Vince Foster; Representative Mike Ross; former Louisville, Kentucky mayor David L. Armstrong; former Arkansas Secretary of State Kelly Bryant (1908-1975), PGA golfer Ken Duke and actress Melinda Dillon. Country Music Hall of Fame singer Patsy Montana attended schools in Hope. A former Michigan congressman, Robert James Huber, is buried in Hope, but he did not live there. It was the hometown of his wife, the former Mary Pauline "Polly" Tolleson, a graduate of Hope High School. Also, Hope is home to a few African-American figures such as Henry C. Yerger, who established a school for African-American students in 1895. (more...)
