The architecture and interior boast an upscale urban design, but the atmosphere is that of an intimate neighborhood haven. Discover a stylish refuge in our 45 rooms, each with elegant refinements and state-of-the-art technology. Every detail from dazzling cuisine to attentive service will enchant the most discerning guest. With one bold red parenthesis of a banquette and a few dashes of cushioned benches, it is just big enough for a few people to meet before dinner at adjoining _BeCa, which has an Italian-leaning menu notable not only for its quality but also for its ample portions and reasonable prices. Compact as a yacht, the hotel anchors the workaday corner of Church and Duane streets, surrounded by TriBeCa's evolving mix of superb shops, galleries, lofts, and restaurants. Light floods the 45 guest rooms, which tend to be small but quiet. Done in cheerful green chartreuse with blond wood, they display quality details, from slate bath tiles to generous white Mama Bear bedding. Each guestroom design includes oversized loft windows, 11-foot ceilings, and hardwood floors. Custom designed furniture, wall panels holding plasma televisions and artwork are crafted of natural wood to match the wood plank flooring. The slate bathrooms incorporate natural materials and a glass shower with rain showerhead. Rooms feature natural blonde hardwood flooring accented by modern furniture. Guest beds all feature a state-of-the-art pillow-top mattress with a washable hygienic liner, as well as 100% cotton linens imported from Europe and a luxurious duvet. The darkly elegant hallways, with glowing silver panels inset in mauve walls, epitomize this fine new property, which clearly and wisely values privacy over flash-in-the-pan popularity.   Duane Street Hotel Property Information: Rooms: 45 Floors: 5   Duane Street Hotel Features Luxury Dry cleaning Pets allowed High speed internet Dining Nonsmoking Business center Car rental desk Duane Street Hotel Reservation Policies: Check-In: 1500 Check-Out: 1200 Please wait.
