Certification of Aerobic Treatment Units This article discusses Aerobic Septic System Certifications (Aeration Septic System Certifications) - Fine bubble aeration septic systems to meet local building or health department requirements and regulations. Here are designs and products for aerobic septic treatment units (ATUs) for onsite waste disposal, also called fine bubble aeration systems. We address aerobic septic system design, features, inspection, repair, and maintenance. Product sources are also listed. Aerobic septic system treatment units (ATUs) are tested and certified by the National Sanitation Foundation which in turn uses the ANSI/NSF Standard 40 Class I effluent limits as the functional target for the treatment system. Before buying and installing an aerobic or aeration treatment system you should ask for and review the documentation about the particular product to confirm that it has been properly specified and is certified as meeting the necessary standards. Of course, even systems that are designed to meet ANSI/NSF Standard 40 Class I effluent limits will not continue to do so unless they are properly installed and properly maintained. The single most common reason cited for failure of aerobic or aeration septic systems in one major study was lack of proper maintenance. (See ATU Failure Rates for details).
