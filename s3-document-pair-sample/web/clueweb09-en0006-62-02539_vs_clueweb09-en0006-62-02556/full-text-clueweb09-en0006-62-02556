Volunteer Visa South Africa SA Migration International was created out of the need for a specialist organization to assist people wishing to volunteer, work, study or open businesses in South Africa. Specifically, we help students and interns obtain their volunteer visa South Africa. Visitors to South Africa soon realized that the country had a lifestyle and standard of living they struggled to find any where else in the world but still lacked the skills and resources to deal with major issues like social development, poverty and health which inevitability was going to hamper the growth of the country. There has been a huge drive to attract volunteers to South Africa to assist with these issues and organisations like African Impact and Drive South Africa sought to address these problems by creating a platform for volunteer work in South Africa. About SA Migration International With this surge in volunteer work, SA Migration International wanted to make it easy for the applicant to come to South Africa and offer assistance without the hassles of applying for permits or standing in queues. Our mission is to process permits in the shortest amount of time and with the least amount of hassles to the applicant. We are able to offer South African volunteer visas/permits for 3 months to 3 years depending on the program. SA Migration International has offices in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town (adjacent to Home Affairs) as well as offices in France, the UK, Ghana and Uganda. From here our representatives can process permits before the candidate arrives in South Africa.
