Royal Westmoreland, Barbados Description: The ground floor entrance to Bali Hai opens onto a spacious hallway with walls of coral stone. This leads to an ante-room, a mirrored bar room, a fully-equipped kitchen and the large living room area, which opens out to a covered verandah. Adjoining this is a private swimming pool with separate gazebo, overlooking an ornamental pond fed by a softly flowing waterfall. On the first floor level, there is a large master bedroom with a sitting area, ensuite bathroom (with shower and tub), king-size bed and TV. There are also two guest houses, each with its own plunge pool, separate bathrooms and shower areas and a central covered terrace looking onto a fountain. Bedroom 1 is located in the pool cottage. This bedroom is equipped with a king-size bed, cable TV and VCR. Bedrooms 3 and 4 are located in the guest house on the lower ground floor. These bedrooms are identical with twin beds (can be made as one). The bathrooms are equipped with outside showers and indoor tubs. All bedrooms are air-conditioned. The lower ground floor area houses the staff quarters, laundry and plant room. The facilities of the Royal Westmorland Golf Course, with its restaurant, gym and tennis courts, are available to guests at the villa. This villa is staffed with a housekeeper. A cook can be supplied at a separate cost. This villa is not suitable for children under the age of 5, or persons with disabilities, as the bedrooms are all remote from the main house. It is well suited for corporate and golf groups. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CLUB HOUSE WILL BE CLOSED UNTIL DECEMBER 1ST, 2008 AS IT UNDERGOES MAJOR CONSTRUCTION. **Please note that most villas operate a No-Smoking Policy. Smoking is not permitted within the villas themselves, but many will allow smoking on the terrace, patio, balcony or garden.
