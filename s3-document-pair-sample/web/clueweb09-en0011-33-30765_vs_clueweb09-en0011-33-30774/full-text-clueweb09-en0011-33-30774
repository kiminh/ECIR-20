The resort operator controls the entire west end of the island and has built walking trails to the lovely little beaches. The resort also has a small turtle hatchery to help re-populate the sea turtles of these beaches. After a 45 minute drive from Port Vila to Havannah Harbur (the resort has a bus for transfers) visitors cross to Tranquillity Island aboard a 22 meter long sailing ketch, the Coongoola. The Coongoola and a small dive boat are both used for SCUBA and snorkel dives around the island. The water is crystal clear, the reefs excellent, the beaches white and soft sand. There are day trips and/or visitors can stay on the island in thatched eco-style bungalows with shared shower and toilet facilities. These are on the southeast side of the island (the Havannah Harbour side) and enjoy trade wind cooling. Deal Direct and contact the owner at Tranquility Island Resort - you can go for a day sail (and snorkel or dive trip) on the Coongoola, explore the island for a day, go Scuba diving, and/or stay at the adventure lodge at budget rates.
