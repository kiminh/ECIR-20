Typically these have a small restaurant operated by the bungalow owner with local foods. The LTC Holiday Unit at Lakatoro, Rose Bay and Tam Tam Bungalows are relatively sophisticated. Visitors to the more remote bungalows should consider bringing their own beverages and some extra tea, coffee, and sugar that can be left behind as a small gift. Photo Kathie Clark Rose Bay Dancers You can't book the bungalows shown with no link through an agent, you have to call them yourself or simply show up. You will pay the bungalow or guest house owner directly in Vatu. Air Vanuatu Tours will book your air tickets and provide the latest advice on the condition and probable occupancy of the village bungalows. Contact David Dick at Air Vanuatu Tours.
