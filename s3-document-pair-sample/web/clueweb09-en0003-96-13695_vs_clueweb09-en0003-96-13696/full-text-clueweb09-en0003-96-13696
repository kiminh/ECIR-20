I've had my license for just about 3 years now - always been on my parent's plan.   Is this too cheap? Too basic? What should I be concerned about? I'm assuming that if the car is financed in my name and the insurance is in my name, they won't go after my 'assets' if something screwy happens (I don't have any assets). If the car is financed, am I required to purchase more coverage?

That's pretty foolish...   That means if you hit someone else you're only covered up to $10,000. God forbid you hit a new Accord even... up that to $50k or better.   You don't need huge liability limits if you don't have much in the way of assets, which I doubt most college students will. #118 of 119 Re: Is it really that expensive? [sandpaper] by oldfarmer50 Sep 04, 2007 (5:54 am) Replying to: sandpaper (Sep 03, 2007 4:37 pm) "...Is it too cheap? Too Basic..."   As to being too cheap, I assume you mean too good to be true. My 20 year old son with a whole ton of points got insurance comparable to you for $650 for 6 months from Progressive. I thought that was a steal.   Too basic? It depends. You have no real assets now I presume so there is nothing to lose. However if you have a major accident a judgment can follow you for many years. You could be paying 10% of your wages for up to 20 years in my state. #119 of 119 Search for better quotes. by autoquotes May 21, 2008 (2:32 am) Hi,   $6,000 for car insurance is simply nuts! Don't know if you have tried Insurance.com or not, but they have a wide variety of top insurance companies that you can compare side-by-side.. Get your free quote and maybe you'll find the right price at Insurance.com..   Take care,   Dan Messages Page 13 of 13 1 ... 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Prev Next Last Go To Msg # Search This Discussion To POST a message, please Sign In.
