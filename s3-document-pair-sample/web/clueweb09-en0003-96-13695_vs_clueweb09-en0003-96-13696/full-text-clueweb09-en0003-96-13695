It would also be fraud if you say that you live at her house when you do not.   As we mentioned earlier, there's nothing (legal) behind door #3. Pay the high insurance rate or buy a car that's cheaper to insure.

Buy that, or something like it, and drive it for at least a year. By then, you'll no longer be a "new driver," and you may find that your rate will go down. #115 of 119 NJ experience by olddog7 Jul 31, 2007 (7:14 pm) I know I'm coming in to this a bit late, but what about renting a car? Sounds like it could be cheaper than even owning a car is that area. Although I don't know who rents cars to such young drivers. If insuring a car in the Bronx is over 12k a year for phase 2k2, maybe he should use the public transportation there and take car service or taxis for more important occassions. #116 of 119 Is it really that expensive? by sandpaper Sep 03, 2007 (4:37 pm) Here's the lowest price I got in the state of WA, using Geico: $516.80 for 2008 Volkswagen Jetta - 6 months Bodily Injury Liability(BI) $25,000 / $50,000 $ 301.5 Property Damage Liability(PD) $10,000 $ 215.30   I am a full-time 4 year university student with good academic standing. I've had my license for just about 3 years now - always been on my parent's plan.   Is this too cheap? Too basic? What should I be concerned about? I'm assuming that if the car is financed in my name and the insurance is in my name, they won't go after my 'assets' if something screwy happens (I don't have any assets). If the car is financed, am I required to purchase more coverage?

[sandpaper] by im_brentwood Sep 03, 2007 (11:10 pm) Replying to: sandpaper (Sep 03, 2007 4:37 pm) $10k in property damage liability? That's pretty foolish...   That means if you hit someone else you're only covered up to $10,000. God forbid you hit a new Accord even... up that to $50k or better.   You don't need huge liability limits if you don't have much in the way of assets, which I doubt most college students will. #118 of 119 Re: Is it really that expensive? [sandpaper] by oldfarmer50 Sep 04, 2007 (5:54 am) Replying to: sandpaper (Sep 03, 2007 4:37 pm) "...Is it too cheap? Too Basic..."   As to being too cheap, I assume you mean too good to be true. My 20 year old son with a whole ton of points got insurance comparable to you for $650 for 6 months from Progressive. I thought that was a steal.   Too basic? It depends. You have no real assets now I presume so there is nothing to lose. However if you have a major accident a judgment can follow you for many years. You could be paying 10% of your wages for up to 20 years in my state.
