On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series will return for its 15th, concluding season.[2] Originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009,[3][4] NBC recently announced it will extend ER by an additional three episodes to a full 22 episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells.[5] ER's final episode is scheduled to air on April 2, 2009 with a one-hour retrospective preceding it.[6] History and production In 1974, author Michael Crichton wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical resident in a busy ER. The screenplay went nowhere, and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel Jurassic Park, and in 1993 began a collaboration with director Steven Spielberg on the film adaptation of that. The Crichton-Spielberg team then returned to ER but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment provided John Wells as the show's executive producer. The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in 1974. The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 made the Dr. Lewis character a woman and the Dr. Benton character an African-American, and shortened the running time by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV.[7] Due to a lack of time and money to build a set, the pilot episode of ER was filmed in the former Linda Vista Community Hospital in Los Angeles, an old facility that ceased operating as a medical center in 1990.[8] A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon after at the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California, although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous "L" train platforms. ER premiered on Monday, September 19, 1994 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. (EDT) and moved into the 10:00 p.m Thursday night timeslot three days later, where it remained for all fifteen seasons. Steven Spielberg left the show after one year in a producer's chair, but he made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original script for the pilot episode, was retained. ER was filmed in 1.78:1 widescreen from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the 1080i HD format where NBC was being broadcast digitally.[citation needed] Since the sixth episode of Season 7, it has appeared in letterbox format when in standard definition. As a result, every US DVD box set shows the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on TNT HD, though the first six seasons still show in fullscreen on the digital TNT network. Only the live episode "Ambush" at the beginning of the fourth season, and the opening credits for the first six seasons, are in standard 4:3 aspect ratio. Episodes Main article: List of ER episodes ER has had many memorable episodes, and is particularly notable for broadcasting a live episode, "Ambush," in 1997, with the NBC camera crew disguised as a PBS crew making a documentary film in the hospital. The actors performed the show again three hours later so that the West Coast airing would be live as well. This episode received Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic), and won the Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Series. Most episodes center on the ER, with almost all scenes at the hospital. There is, however, often at least one scene showing the goings-on of the ER staff outside the hospital. Also, there is a tradition to feature storylines each season completely outside of the ER. One early such instance involved a road trip near Las Vegas, Nevada (Drs. Ross and Greene). Season Eight included a storyline in Hawaii (Drs. Greene and Corday). More recently, the series has included storylines in Democratic Republic of Congo (Drs. Kovac and Carter) and Darfur, Sudan (Drs. Pratt and Carter, with Noah Wyle appearing as a guest star in the season following his departure from the show). Cast Main cast The original cast consisted of Anthony Edwards as Dr. Mark Greene, George Clooney as Dr. Doug Ross, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis, Noah Wyle as John Carter, and Eriq La Salle as Dr. Peter Benton. Julianna Margulies guest starred in the pilot as Carol Hathaway before becoming part of the regular cast. The first additions to the cast came in Season Two with Jeanie Boulet (Gloria Reuben) and Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) signing on. The cast remained largely unchanged until Season Five, when Kellie Martin joined the cast as medical student Lucy Knight and George Clooney became the first major departure. As a result, Season Six opened with addition of then-unknown Croatian actor Goran Visnjic to the cast as the tragic Dr. Luka Kovac and soon after, Maura Tierney as Abby Lockhart, who together formed the series longest running, and most complicated, romantic relationship. By the end of Season Eight, only one member of the original cast, Noah Wyle, remained. Wyle departed in Season Eleven, followed by Laura Innes in Season Thirteen, and finally Maura Tierney and Goran Visnjic in early Season Fifteen, ending the final connections to main body of the original cast.

The main result was the replacement of all principal characters from the pilot episode between Season Five (Doug Ross) and Season Twelve (John Carter). Writers and producers maintained continuity by frequently introducing new principals and by persuading actors to return for extra-contractual scenes after their characters' departures. The first of these scenes came at the end of Season Six, when George Clooney (as Doug Ross) is seen briefly in the final appearance of the Carol Hathaway character. The next of these scenes came at the end of Season Eight when Eriq La Salle (as Peter Benton) and Michael Michele (as Cleo Finch) are seen briefly at Mark Greene's funeral. More recent scenes have included guest appearances by Sharif Atkins in Seasons Eleven and Twelve, Noah Wyle in Season Twelve, and Gloria Reuben in Season Fourteen, leading to a series of guest appearances in Season Fifteen by some of the former cast, including Shane West, Anthony Edwards, Laura Innes, Paul McCrane, Alex Kingston, and longtime supporting actors Abraham Benrubi and William H. Macy. Continuity has also been maintained by the frequent appearances of secondary characters such as Nurses Haleh Adams, Lily Jarvik, Malik McGrath, and Chuni Marquez (played by Yvette Freeman, Lily Mariye, Deezer D, and Laura Ceron, respectively) and Paramedics Dwight Zadro (Mont�� Russell) and Doris Pickman (Emily Wagner). Finally, Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver) and Paul McCrane (Robert Romano) have regularly returned to the set of ER as directors, most recently in the Season 15 episode "Age of Innocence" (McCrane) and the Season 14 episode "Coming Home" (Innes). Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton) is scheduled to direct the Season 15 episode "The Family Man."[10] Main cast departures Sherry Stringfield's first departure on the show was in 1996, when her character, Susan Lewis, moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in the Season 3 episode "Union Station." In 2001, Stringfield returned to the series, reprising her role of Dr. Lewis, in the Season 8 episode "Never Say Never." She departed again in the Season 12 premiere, "Canon City." This second departure was not depicted, but rather mentioned by character Kerry Weaver four episodes later in "Wake Up," when she explains that Susan had accepted a tenure-track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, after having been denied tenure at County. After playing Anna Del Amico for one season, Maria Bello was not a part of the ensemble cast when Season 5 began. Like Susan Lewis's second exit, her character's departure was mentioned but not depicted; in the season premiere, "Day for Knight," Carter explains to new medical student Lucy Knight that the locker she is inheriting used to belong to Anna Del Amico, who is working in a pediatric ER back in Philadelphia, where she has family and a boyfriend. George Clooney left the show in 1999, in the Season 5 episode "The Storm, Part 2," when his character, Doug Ross, quit before being fired by County for his involvement in a patient's death. Clooney returned in the season 6 episode "Such Sweet Sorrow" in a cameo when his character reunited with Carol Hathaway. Gloria Reuben departed early in Season 6, in the episode "The Peace of Wild Things," when her character, Jeanie Boulet, decided to become a stay-at-home mom and care for her newly adopted HIV-positive baby. Reuben returned in the season 14 episode "Status Quo" with her HIV positive child. Kellie Martin, who played medical student Lucy Knight, left the series midway through Season 6 in the episode "All In The Family," when her character was killed by a patient suffering from undiagnosed schizophrenia; his psychotic break occurred before a backed-up psychiatry department could arrive in the ER for a consult. Julianna Margulies left the show at the end of Season 6, in the episode "Such Sweet Sorrow," when her character, Carol Hathaway, decided on the spur of the moment to go to Seattle, Washington, and reunite with Doug Ross, her true love and the father of her twin daughters. Erik Palladino departed early in Season 8, in the episode ("Never Say Never") after his character, Dave Malucci, was fired for inappropriate conduct. Eriq La Salle's character, Peter Benton, departed in the Season 8 episode "I'll Be Home For Christmas". He took a job with a set schedule at another hospital in order to spend more time with his son, Reese, and his girlfriend, former fellow ER doctor Cleo Finch. La Salle returned in the season 8 episodes "It's All in Your Head" in a cameo to speak with Elizabeth Corday and "On the Beach" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral. Michael Michele's character, Cleo Finch, departed in the Season 8 episode "I'll Be Home For Christmas" with her boyfriend, and fellow doctor, Peter Benton, after having previously taken a job at the same hospital with set schedules (in fact it was she who arranged the interview which resulted in Benton's job offer). Michele returned in the season 8 episode "On the Beach" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral. Anthony Edwards's character, Mark Greene, died of a brain tumor in Season 8's penultimate episode, "On the Beach." Unusually, Anthony Edwards was credited in the following episode "Lockdown". Edwards returned in the 15th season episode "Heal Thyself" where he appeared in multiple flashback scenes to give insight into the past of Angela Bassett's character.[11] Paul McCrane's character, Robert Romano, whose arm had been severed just above the elbow by a helicopter's tail rotor in the Season 9 premiere "Chaos Theory," was killed in the Season 10 episode "Freefall" when a helicopter that was taking off from the hospital roof was buffeted by strong winds, causing it to crash on the roof and plummet over the side of the building; it fell into a crowded ambulance bay and landed squarely on Romano. McCrane returned in the 15th season episode "Heal Thyself" in a cameo during flashbacks. Sharif Atkins left the series in the Season 10 episode "Where There's Smoke," when his character, Michael Gallant, revealed that the Army was sending him to Iraq. Atkins returned in the Season 11 episodes "Here and There" and "Back in the World" in several scenes taking place in Iraq and then again in the season 12 episodes "Two Ships," "I Do," "Split Decisions," and "The Gallant Hero and The Tragic Victor" where he married Neela and then returned to Iraq where he was killed by an improvised explosive device while serving a second tour there. Alex Kingston's character, Elizabeth Corday, left the series in the Season 11 episode "Fear" after getting in trouble for performing an illegal organ donation procedure; rather than being summarily fired, County offered her a demotion to a non-tenured position, but she turned it down and opted to return to England instead. In an interview with Britain's Radio Times magazine, Kingston spoke of being written off the show due to her age, a statement that sparked some controversy. She later withdrew that claim.[12] Kingston returned in the 15th season episode "Dream Runner" in two of Neela's dream sequences.[13] Ming-Na left in Season 11 as an attending physician when her character, Jing-Mei Chen, resigned in in order to take care of her ailing father, whom she later euthanized in the episode "Twas the Night." This was the second time her character left County General; in season 1, medical student "Deb" Chen recurred in an eight episode story arc which concluded with her leaving medical school after accidentally leaving a guide wire in a patient's chest and deciding she was better suited to do research than to do applied medicine. Noah Wyle left in the Season 11 finale, "The Show Must Go On." His character, John Carter, after having received tenure at County, decided to reunite with his girlfriend Kem Likasu (portrayed by Thandie Newton). Wyle returned in the season 12 episodes "Quintessence of Dust," "Darfur," "No Place to Hide," and "There Are No Angels Here" where he is practicing medicine in Darfur. Laura Innes left midway through Season 13, in the episode "A House Divided," when a reluctant Luka Kova�� was forced by budget cuts to fire her character, Kerry Weaver. After bracing for a battle to keep her position, and in spite of the fact that Kova�� realized he must find a way to keep her on staff, Weaver ultimately decided to resign from County and accept a job offer from a television station in Miami, Florida. Innes returned in the 15th season episode "Heal Thyself" in a cameo during flashbacks. Shane West left at the end of the 13th season after his character, Ray Barnett lost both his legs and returned to Baton Rouge with his mother to recuperate. West's final appearance as a main cast member was in "The Honeymoon is Over." West returned in the 15th season episode "Haunted" to visit Neela and the rest of the staff. Mekhi Phifer departed during the first episode of Season 15. His character, Gregory Pratt, died in the ER as the result of blast injuries suffered in an ambulance explosion in the final episode of Season 14. Goran Visnjic departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled "Book of Abby" with his TV wife Abby Lockhart. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job. [3] Luka had previously left the show in the season finale of season 13 when he left for Croatia to care for his ailing father. He returned for seven episodes in season 14 to wrap up his medical storyline and then made a brief appearance in "Book of Abby" where he, Abby, and their son Joe embark on their new life together. Maura Tierney departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled "Book of Abby" with her TV husband Luka Kovac. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job. [3] She attempted to leave the ER quietly, however the rest of the staff made it known how much they will miss her. Nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby a hidden wall with the locker labels of all the past staff members since season one, with the exception of Carter who refused to deface government property (the other names on the wall were mostly departed former characters as well as some prominent writers and producers). Abby then left the ER and met Luka and her son Joe outside where they embark on their new life together.
